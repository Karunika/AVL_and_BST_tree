the voyage of the beagle
charles darwin

preface

i have stated in the preface to the first edition of this work and in
the zoology of the voyage of the beagle that it was in consequence of
a wish expressed by captain fitz roy of having some scientific person
on board accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own
accommodations that i volunteered my services which received through
the kindness of the hydrographer captain beaufort the sanction of the
lords of the admiralty as i feel that the opportunities which i
enjoyed of studying the natural history of the different countries we
visited have been wholly due to captain fitz roy i hope i may here be
permitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him and to add that 
during the five years we were together i received from him the most
cordial friendship and steady assistance both to captain fitz roy and
to all the officers of the beagle i shall ever feel most thankful
for the undeviating kindness with which i was treated during our long
voyage 

this volume contains in the form of a journal a history of our
voyage and a sketch of those observations in natural history and
geology which i think will possess some interest for the general
reader i have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some
parts and have added a little to others in order to render the volume
more fitted for popular reading but i trust that naturalists will
remember that they must refer for details to the larger publications
which comprise the scientific results of the expedition the zoology
of the voyage of the beagle includes an account of the fossil mammalia 
by professor owen of the living mammalia by mr waterhouse of the
birds by mr gould of the fish by the rev l jenyns and of the
reptiles by mr bell i have appended to the descriptions of each
species an account of its habits and range these works which i owe
to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished
authors could not have been undertaken had it not been for the
liberality of the lords commissioners of her majesty s treasury who 
through the representation of the right honourable the chancellor of
the exchequer have been pleased to grant a sum of one thousand pounds
towards defraying part of the expenses of publication 

i have myself published separate volumes on the structure and
distribution of coral reefs on the volcanic islands visited during
the voyage of the beagle and on the geology of south america the
sixth volume of the geological transactions contains two papers of
mine on the erratic boulders and volcanic phenomena of south america 
messrs waterhouse walker newman and white have published several
able papers on the insects which were collected and i trust that many
others will hereafter follow the plants from the southern parts of
america will be given by dr j hooker in his great work on the botany
of the southern hemisphere the flora of the galapagos archipelago is
the subject of a separate memoir by him in the linnean transactions 
the reverend professor henslow has published a list of the plants
collected by me at the keeling islands and the reverend j m berkeley
has described my cryptogamic plants 

i shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which i
have received from several other naturalists in the course of this and
my other works but i must be here allowed to return my most sincere
thanks to the reverend professor henslow who when i was an
undergraduate at cambridge was one chief means of giving me a taste
for natural history who during my absence took charge of the
collections i sent home and by his correspondence directed my
endeavours and who since my return has constantly rendered me every
assistance which the kindest friend could offer 

down bromley kent june 

 i must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to mr 
bynoe the surgeon of the beagle for his very kind attention to me
when i was ill at valparaiso

after having been twice driven back by heavy southwestern gales her
majesty s ship beagle a ten-gun brig under the command of captain
fitz roy r n sailed from devonport on the th of december 
the object of the expedition was to complete the survey of patagonia
and tierra del fuego commenced under captain king in to to
survey the shores of chile peru and of some islands in the
pacific and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the
world on the th of january we reached teneriffe but were prevented
landing by fears of our bringing the cholera the next morning we saw
the sun rise behind the rugged outline of the grand canary island and
suddenly illuminate the peak of teneriffe whilst the lower parts were
veiled in fleecy clouds this was the first of many delightful days
never to be forgotten on the th of january we anchored at
porto praya in st jago the chief island of the cape de verd
archipelago 

the neighbourhood of porto praya viewed from the sea wears a desolate
aspect the volcanic fires of a past age and the scorching heat of a
tropical sun have in most places rendered the soil unfit for
vegetation the country rises in successive steps of table-land 
interspersed with some truncate conical hills and the horizon is
bounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains the scene as
beheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate is one of great
interest if indeed a person fresh from sea and who has just
walked for the first time in a grove of cocoa-nut trees can be a
judge of anything but his own happiness the island would generally be
considered as very uninteresting but to anyone accustomed only to an
english landscape the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land
possesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil a single green
leaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains 
yet flocks of goats together with a few cows contrive to exist it
rains very seldom but during a short portion of the year heavy
torrents fall and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs
out of every crevice this soon withers and upon such naturally
formed hay the animals live it had not now rained for an entire year 
when the island was discovered the immediate neighbourhood of porto
praya was clothed with trees the reckless destruction of which has
caused here as at st helena and at some of the canary islands 
almost entire sterility the broad flat-bottomed valleys many of
which serve during a few days only in the season as water-courses are
clothed with thickets of leafless bushes few living creatures inhabit
these valleys the commonest bird is a kingfisher dacelo iagoensis 
which tamely sits on the branches of the castor-oil plant and thence
darts on grasshoppers and lizards it is brightly coloured but not so
beautiful as the european species in its flight manners and place of
habitation which is generally in the driest valley there is also a
wide difference 

one day two of the officers and myself rode to ribeira grande a
village a few miles eastward of porto praya until we reached the
valley of st martin the country presented its usual dull brown
appearance but here a very small rill of water produces a most
refreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation in the course of an hour we
arrived at ribeira grande and were surprised at the sight of a large
ruined fort and cathedral this little town before its harbour was
filled up was the principal place in the island it now presents a
melancholy but very picturesque appearance having procured a black
padre for a guide and a spaniard who had served in the peninsular war
as an interpreter we visited a collection of buildings of which an
ancient church formed the principal part it is here the governors and
captain-generals of the islands have been buried some of the
tombstones recorded dates of the sixteenth century 

the heraldic ornaments were the only things in this retired place that
reminded us of europe the church or chapel formed one side of a
quadrangle in the middle of which a large clump of bananas were
growing on another side was a hospital containing about a dozen
miserable-looking inmates 

we returned to the venda to eat our dinners a considerable number of
men women and children all as black as jet collected to watch us 
our companions were extremely merry and everything we said or did was
followed by their hearty laughter before leaving the town we visited
the cathedral it does not appear so rich as the smaller church but
boasts of a little organ which sent forth singularly inharmonious
cries we presented the black priest with a few shillings and the
spaniard patting him on the head said with much candour he thought
his colour made no great difference we then returned as fast as the
ponies would go to porto praya 

another day we rode to the village of st domingo situated near the
centre of the island on a small plain which we crossed a few stunted
acacias were growing their tops had been bent by the steady
trade-wind in a singular manner some of them even at right angles to
their trunks the direction of the branches was exactly n e by n 
and s w by s and these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing
direction of the force of the trade-wind the travelling had made so
little impression on the barren soil that we here missed our track 
and took that to fuentes this we did not find out till we arrived
there and we were afterwards glad of our mistake fuentes is a pretty
village with a small stream and everything appeared to prosper well 
excepting indeed that which ought to do so most its inhabitants the
black children completely naked and looking very wretched were
carrying bundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies 

near fuentes we saw a large flock of guinea-fowl probably fifty or
sixty in number they were extremely wary and could not be
approached they avoided us like partridges on a rainy day in
september running with their heads cocked up and if pursued they
readily took to the wing 

the scenery of st domingo possesses a beauty totally unexpected from
the prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island the village
is situated at the bottom of a valley bounded by lofty and jagged
walls of stratified lava the black rocks afford a most striking
contrast with the bright green vegetation which follows the banks of a
little stream of clear water it happened to be a grand feast-day and
the village was full of people on our return we overtook a party of
about twenty young black girls dressed in excellent taste their black
skins and snow-white linen being set off by coloured turbans and large
shawls as soon as we approached near they suddenly all turned round 
and covering the path with their shawls sung with great energy a wild
song beating time with their hands upon their legs we threw them some
vintems which were received with screams of laughter and we left them
redoubling the noise of their song 

one morning the view was singularly clear the distant mountains being
projected with the sharpest outline on a heavy bank of dark blue
clouds judging from the appearance and from similar cases in
england i supposed that the air was saturated with moisture the
fact however turned out quite the contrary the hygrometer gave a
difference of degs between the temperature of the air and the
point at which dew was precipitated this difference was nearly double
that which i had observed on the previous mornings this unusual
degree of atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of
lightning is it not an uncommon case thus to find a remarkable
degree of aerial transparency with such a state of weather 

generally the atmosphere is hazy and this is caused by the falling of
impalpably fine dust which was found to have slightly injured the
astronomical instruments the morning before we anchored at porto
praya i collected a little packet of this brown-coloured fine dust 
which appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the
vane at the mast-head mr lyell has also given me four packets of
dust which fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these
islands professor ehrenberg finds that this dust consists in
great part of infusoria with siliceous shields and of the siliceous
tissue of plants in five little packets which i sent him he has
ascertained no less than sixty-seven different organic forms the
infusoria with the exception of two marine species are all
inhabitants of fresh-water i have found no less than fifteen
different accounts of dust having fallen on vessels when far out in the
atlantic from the direction of the wind whenever it has fallen and
from its having always fallen during those months when the harmattan is
known to raise clouds of dust high into the atmosphere we may feel
sure that it all comes from africa it is however a very singular
fact that although professor ehrenberg knows many species of
infusoria peculiar to africa he finds none of these in the dust which
i sent him on the other hand he finds in it two species which
hitherto he knows as living only in south america the dust falls in
such quantities as to dirty everything on board and to hurt people s
eyes vessels even have run on shore owing to the obscurity of the
atmosphere it has often fallen on ships when several hundred and
even more than a thousand miles from the coast of africa and at points
sixteen hundred miles distant in a north and south direction in some
dust which was collected on a vessel three hundred miles from the land 
i was much surprised to find particles of stone above the thousandth of
an inch square mixed with finer matter after this fact one need not
be surprised at the diffusion of the far lighter and smaller sporules
of cryptogamic plants 

the geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural
history on entering the harbour a perfectly horizontal white band 
in the face of the sea cliff may be seen running for some miles along
the coast and at the height of about forty-five feet above the water 
upon examination this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous
matter with numerous shells embedded most or all of which now exist on
the neighbouring coast it rests on ancient volcanic rocks and has
been covered by a stream of basalt which must have entered the sea
when the white shelly bed was lying at the bottom it is interesting
to trace the changes produced by the heat of the overlying lava on the
friable mass which in parts has been converted into a crystalline
limestone and in other parts into a compact spotted stone where the
lime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower
surface of the stream it is converted into groups of beautifully
radiated fibres resembling arragonite the beds of lava rise in
successive gently-sloping plains towards the interior whence the
deluges of melted stone have originally proceeded within historical
times no signs of volcanic activity have i believe been manifested
in any part of st jago even the form of a crater can but rarely be
discovered on the summits of the many red cindery hills yet the more
recent streams can be distinguished on the coast forming lines of
cliffs of less height but stretching out in advance of those belonging
to an older series the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude
measure of the age of the streams 

during our stay i observed the habits of some marine animals a large
aplysia is very common this sea-slug is about five inches long and
is of a dirty yellowish colour veined with purple on each side of the
lower surface or foot there is a broad membrane which appears
sometimes to act as a ventilator in causing a current of water to flow
over the dorsal branchiae or lungs it feeds on the delicate sea-weeds
which grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water and i found in
its stomach several small pebbles as in the gizzard of a bird this
slug when disturbed emits a very fine purplish-red fluid which
stains the water for the space of a foot around besides this means of
defence an acrid secretion which is spread over its body causes a
sharp stinging sensation similar to that produced by the physalia or
portuguese man-of-war 

i was much interested on several occasions by watching the habits of
an octopus or cuttle-fish although common in the pools of water left
by the retiring tide these animals were not easily caught by means
of their long arms and suckers they could drag their bodies into very
narrow crevices and when thus fixed it required great force to remove
them at other times they darted tail first with the rapidity of an
arrow from one side of the pool to the other at the same instant
discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink these animals
also escape detection by a very extraordinary chameleon-like power of
changing their colour they appear to vary their tints according to the
nature of the ground over which they pass when in deep water their
general shade was brownish purple but when placed on the land or in
shallow water this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green 
the colour examined more carefully was a french grey with numerous
minute spots of bright yellow the former of these varied in intensity 
the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns these
changes were effected in such a manner that clouds varying in tint
between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown were continually
passing over the body any part being subjected to a slight shock of
galvanism became almost black a similar effect but in a less degree 
was produced by scratching the skin with a needle these clouds or
blushes as they may be called are said to be produced by the alternate
expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously
coloured fluids 

this cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act
of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom i was much
amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual 
which seemed fully aware that i was watching it remaining for a time
motionless it would then stealthily advance an inch or two like a cat
after a mouse sometimes changing its colour it thus proceeded till
having gained a deeper part it darted away leaving a dusky train of
ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled 

while looking for marine animals with my head about two feet above the
rocky shore i was more than once saluted by a jet of water 
accompanied by a slight grating noise at first i could not think what
it was but afterwards i found out that it was this cuttle-fish which 
though concealed in a hole thus often led me to its discovery that
it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt and it
appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the
tube or siphon on the under side of its body from the difficulty
which these animals have in carrying their heads they cannot crawl
with ease when placed on the ground i observed that one which i kept
in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark 

st paul s rocks in crossing the atlantic we hove-to during the
morning of february th close to the island of st paul s this
cluster of rocks is situated in degs north latitude and 
degs west longitude it is miles distant from the coast of
america and from the island of fernando noronha the highest
point is only fifty feet above the level of the sea and the entire
circumference is under three-quarters of a mile this small point
rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean its mineralogical
constitution is not simple in some parts the rock is of a cherty in
others of a felspathic nature including thin veins of serpentine it
is a remarkable fact that all the many small islands lying far from
any continent in the pacific indian and atlantic oceans with the
exception of the seychelles and this little point of rock are i
believe composed either of coral or of erupted matter the volcanic
nature of these oceanic islands is evidently an extension of that law 
and the effect of those same causes whether chemical or mechanical 
from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in
action stand either near sea-coasts or as islands in the midst of the
sea 

the rocks of st paul appear from a distance of a brilliantly white
colour this is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of
seafowl and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a
pearly lustre which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks 
this when examined with a lens is found to consist of numerous
exceedingly thin layers its total thickness being about the tenth of
an inch it contains much animal matter and its origin no doubt is
due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds dung below some
small masses of guano at ascension and on the abrolhos islets i found
certain stalactitic branching bodies formed apparently in the same
manner as the thin white coating on these rocks the branching bodies
so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae a family
of hard calcareous sea-plants that in lately looking hastily over my
collection i did not perceive the difference the globular extremities
of the branches are of a pearly texture like the enamel of teeth but
so hard as just to scratch plate-glass i may here mention that on a
part of the coast of ascension where there is a vast accumulation of
shelly sand an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks by the
water of the sea resembling as represented in the woodcut certain
cryptogamic plants marchantiae often seen on damp walls the surface
of the fronds is beautifully glossy and those parts formed where fully
exposed to the light are of a jet black colour but those shaded under
ledges are only grey i have shown specimens of this incrustation to
several geologists and they all thought that they were of volcanic or
igneous origin in its hardness and translucency in its polish equal
to that of the finest oliva-shell in the bad smell given out and loss
of colour under the blowpipe it shows a close similarity with living
sea-shells moreover in sea-shells it is known that the parts
habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal are of a
paler colour than those fully exposed to the light just as is the case
with this incrustation when we remember that lime either as a
phosphate or carbonate enters into the composition of the hard parts 
such as bones and shells of all living animals it is an interesting
physiological fact to find substances harder than the enamel of
teeth and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh
shell reformed through inorganic means from dead organic
matter mocking also in shape some of the lower vegetable
productions 

we found on st paul s only two kinds of birds the booby and the
noddy the former is a species of gannet and the latter a tern both
are of a tame and stupid disposition and are so unaccustomed to
visitors that i could have killed any number of them with my
geological hammer the booby lays her eggs on the bare rock but the
tern makes a very simple nest with sea-weed by the side of many of
these nests a small flying-fish was placed which i suppose had been
brought by the male bird for its partner it was amusing to watch how
quickly a large and active crab graspus which inhabits the crevices
of the rock stole the fish from the side of the nest as soon as we
had disturbed the parent birds sir w symonds one of the few persons
who have landed here informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even
the young birds out of their nests and devouring them not a single
plant not even a lichen grows on this islet yet it is inhabited by
several insects and spiders the following list completes i believe 
the terrestrial fauna a fly olfersia living on the booby and a tick
which must have come here as a parasite on the birds a small brown
moth belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers a beetle quedius 
and a woodlouse from beneath the dung and lastly numerous spiders 
which i suppose prey on these small attendants and scavengers of the
water-fowl the often repeated description of the stately palm and
other noble tropical plants then birds and lastly man taking
possession of the coral islets as soon as formed in the pacific is
probably not correct i fear it destroys the poetry of this story that
feather and dirt-feeding and parasitic insects and spiders should be
the first inhabitants of newly formed oceanic land 

the smallest rock in the tropical seas by giving a foundation for the
growth of innumerable kinds of sea-weed and compound animals supports
likewise a large number of fish the sharks and the seamen in the boats
maintained a constant struggle which should secure the greater share of
the prey caught by the fishing-lines i have heard that a rock near
the bermudas lying many miles out at sea and at a considerable depth 
was first discovered by the circumstance of fish having been observed
in the neighbourhood 

fernando noronha feb th as far as i was enabled to observe 
during the few hours we stayed at this place the constitution of the
island is volcanic but probably not of a recent date the most
remarkable feature is a conical hill about one thousand feet high the
upper part of which is exceedingly steep and on one side overhangs its
base the rock is phonolite and is divided into irregular columns on
viewing one of these isolated masses at first one is inclined to
believe that it has been suddenly pushed up in a semi-fluid state at
st helena however i ascertained that some pinnacles of a nearly
similar figure and constitution had been formed by the injection of
melted rock into yielding strata which thus had formed the moulds for
these gigantic obelisks the whole island is covered with wood but
from the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance 
half-way up the mountain some great masses of the columnar rock 
shaded by laurel-like trees and ornamented by others covered with fine
pink flowers but without a single leaf gave a pleasing effect to the
nearer parts of the scenery 

bahia or san salvador brazil feb th the day has passed
delightfully delight itself however is a weak term to express the
feelings of a naturalist who for the first time has wandered by
himself in a brazilian forest the elegance of the grasses the
novelty of the parasitical plants the beauty of the flowers the
glossy green of the foliage but above all the general luxuriance of
the vegetation filled me with admiration a most paradoxical mixture
of sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood the noise
from the insects is so loud that it may be heard even in a vessel
anchored several hundred yards from the shore yet within the recesses
of the forest a universal silence appears to reign to a person fond
of natural history such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure
than he can ever hope to experience again after wandering about for
some hours i returned to the landing-place but before reaching it i
was overtaken by a tropical storm i tried to find shelter under a
tree which was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by
common english rain but here in a couple of minutes a little torrent
flowed down the trunk it is to this violence of the rain that we must
attribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods if the
showers were like those of a colder climate the greater part would be
absorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground i will not at
present attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this noble bay 
because in our homeward voyage we called here a second time and i
shall then have occasion to remark on it 

along the whole coast of brazil for a length of at least miles 
and certainly for a considerable space inland wherever solid rock
occurs it belongs to a granitic formation the circumstance of this
enormous area being constituted of materials which most geologists
believe to have been crystallized when heated under pressure gives
rise to many curious reflections was this effect produced beneath the
depths of a profound ocean or did a covering of strata formerly extend
over it which has since been removed can we believe that any power 
acting for a time short of infinity could have denuded the granite
over so many thousand square leagues 

on a point not far from the city where a rivulet entered the sea i
observed a fact connected with a subject discussed by humboldt at
the cataracts of the great rivers orinoco nile and congo the
syenitic rocks are coated by a black substance appearing as if they
had been polished with plumbago the layer is of extreme thinness and
on analysis by berzelius it was found to consist of the oxides of
manganese and iron in the orinoco it occurs on the rocks periodically
washed by the floods and in those parts alone where the stream is
rapid or as the indians say the rocks are black where the waters
are white here the coating is of a rich brown instead of a black
colour and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone hand
specimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones
which glitter in the sun s rays they occur only within the limits of
the tidal waves and as the rivulet slowly trickles down the surf must
supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers in
like manner the rise and fall of the tide probably answer to the
periodical inundations and thus the same effects are produced under
apparently different but really similar circumstances the origin 
however of these coatings of metallic oxides which seem as if
cemented to the rocks is not understood and no reason i believe can
be assigned for their thickness remaining the same 

one day i was amused by watching the habits of the diodon antennatus 
which was caught swimming near the shore this fish with its flabby
skin is well known to possess the singular power of distending itself
into a nearly spherical form after having been taken out of water for
a short time and then again immersed in it a considerable quantity
both of water and air is absorbed by the mouth and perhaps likewise by
the branchial orifices this process is effected by two methods the
air is swallowed and is then forced into the cavity of the body its
return being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally
visible but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth 
which is kept wide open and motionless this latter action must 
therefore depend on suction the skin about the abdomen is much
looser than that on the back hence during the inflation the lower
surface becomes far more distended than the upper and the fish in
consequence floats with its back downwards cuvier doubts whether the
diodon in this position is able to swim but not only can it thus move
forward in a straight line but it can turn round to either side this
latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins the
tail being collapsed and not used from the body being buoyed up with
so much air the branchial openings are out of water but a stream
drawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them 

the fish having remained in this distended state for a short time 
generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the
branchial apertures and mouth it could emit at will a certain
portion of the water and it appears therefore probable that this
fluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific
gravity this diodon possessed several means of defence it could
give a severe bite and could eject water from its mouth to some
distance at the same time making a curious noise by the movement of
its jaws by the inflation of its body the papillae with which the
skin is covered become erect and pointed but the most curious
circumstance is that it secretes from the skin of its belly when
handled a most beautiful carmine-red fibrous matter which stains
ivory and paper in so permanent a manner that the tint is retained with
all its brightness to the present day i am quite ignorant of the
nature and use of this secretion i have heard from dr allan of
forres that he has frequently found a diodon floating alive and
distended in the stomach of the shark and that on several occasions
he has known it eat its way not only through the coats of the stomach 
but through the sides of the monster which has thus been killed who
would ever have imagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed
the great and savage shark 

march th we sailed from bahia a few days afterwards when not far
distant from the abrolhos islets my attention was called to a
reddish-brown appearance in the sea the whole surface of the water 
as it appeared under a weak lens seemed as if covered by chopped bits
of hay with their ends jagged these are minute cylindrical
confervae in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in each mr 
berkeley informs me that they are the same species trichodesmium
erythraeum with that found over large spaces in the red sea and
whence its name of red sea is derived their numbers must be
infinite the ship passed through several bands of them one of which
was about ten yards wide and judging from the mud-like colour of the
water at least two and a half miles long in almost every long voyage
some account is given of these confervae they appear especially
common in the sea near australia and off cape leeuwin i found an
allied but smaller and apparently different species captain cook in
his third voyage remarks that the sailors gave to this appearance the
name of sea-sawdust 

near keeling atoll in the indian ocean i observed many little masses
of confervae a few inches square consisting of long cylindrical
threads of excessive thinness so as to be barely visible to the naked
eye mingled with other rather larger bodies finely conical at both
ends two of these are shown in the woodcut united together they
vary in length from to and even to of an inch in length 
and in diameter from to of an inch near one extremity of
the cylindrical part a green septum formed of granular matter and
thickest in the middle may generally be seen this i believe is the
bottom of a most delicate colourless sac composed of a pulpy
substance which lines the exterior case but does not extend within
the extreme conical points in some specimens small but perfect
spheres of brownish granular matter supplied the places of the septa 
and i observed the curious process by which they were produced the
pulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into
lines some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre it
then continued with an irregular and rapid movement to contract
itself so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a
perfect little sphere which occupied the position of the septum at one
end of the now quite hollow case the formation of the granular sphere
was hastened by any accidental injury i may add that frequently a
pair of these bodies were attached to each other as represented above 
cone beside cone at that end where the septum occurs 

i will add here a few other observations connected with the
discoloration of the sea from organic causes on the coast of chile a
few leagues north of concepcion the beagle one day passed through
great bands of muddy water exactly like that of a swollen river and
again a degree south of valparaiso when fifty miles from the land 
the same appearance was still more extensive some of the water placed
in a glass was of a pale reddish tint and examined under a
microscope was seen to swarm with minute animalcula darting about and
often exploding their shape is oval and contracted in the middle by
a ring of vibrating curved ciliae it was however very difficult to
examine them with care for almost the instant motion ceased even
while crossing the field of vision their bodies burst sometimes both
ends burst at once sometimes only one and a quantity of coarse 
brownish granular matter was ejected the animal an instant before
bursting expanded to half again its natural size and the explosion
took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had
ceased in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a
rotatory movement on the longer axis about two minutes after any
number were isolated in a drop of water they thus perished the
animals move with the narrow apex forwards by the aid of their
vibratory ciliae and generally by rapid starts they are exceedingly
minute and quite invisible to the naked eye only covering a space
equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch their numbers were
infinite for the smallest drop of water which i could remove contained
very many in one day we passed through two spaces of water thus
stained one of which alone must have extended over several square
miles what incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals the
colour of the water as seen at some distance was like that of a river
which has flowed through a red clay district but under the shade of
the vessel s side it was quite as dark as chocolate the line where
the red and blue water joined was distinctly defined the weather for
some days previously had been calm and the ocean abounded to an
unusual degree with living creatures 

in the sea around tierra del fuego and at no great distance from the
land i have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour from
the number of crustacea which somewhat resemble in form large prawns 
the sealers call them whale-food whether whales feed on them i do not
know but terns cormorants and immense herds of great unwieldy seals
derive on some parts of the coast their chief sustenance from these
swimming crabs seamen invariably attribute the discoloration of the
water to spawn but i found this to be the case only on one occasion 
at the distance of several leagues from the archipelago of the
galapagos the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish or
mud-like water these strips were some miles long but only a few yards
wide and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous
yet distinct margin the colour was caused by little gelatinous balls 
about the fifth of an inch in diameter in which numerous minute
spherical ovules were imbedded they were of two distinct kinds one
being of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other i
cannot form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these
belonged captain colnett remarks that this appearance is very common
among the galapagos islands and that the directions of the bands
indicate that of the currents in the described case however the line
was caused by the wind the only other appearance which i have to
notice is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent
colours i saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the
coast of brazil the seamen attributed it to the putrefying carcase of
some whale which probably was floating at no great distance i do not
here mention the minute gelatinous particles hereafter to be referred
to which are frequently dispersed throughout the water for they are
not sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour 

there are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear
remarkable first how do the various bodies which form the bands with
defined edges keep together in the case of the prawn-like crabs 
their movements were as co-instantaneous as in a regiment of soldiers 
but this cannot happen from anything like voluntary action with the
ovules or the confervae nor is it probable among the infusoria 
secondly what causes the length and narrowness of the bands the
appearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent 
where the stream uncoils into long streaks the froth collected in the
eddies that i must attribute the effect to a similar action either of
the currents of the air or sea under this supposition we must believe
that the various organized bodies are produced in certain favourable
places and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water i
confess however there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one
spot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of animalcula and
confervae for whence come the germs at such points the parent bodies
having been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean 
but on no other hypothesis can i understand their linear grouping i
may add that scoresby remarks that green water abounding with pelagic
animals is invariably found in a certain part of the arctic sea 

 i state this on the authority of dr e dieffenbach in his german
translation of the first edition of this journal 

 the cape de verd islands were discovered in there was a
tombstone of a bishop with the date of and a crest of a hand and
dagger dated 

 i must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness
with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my
specimens i have sent june a full account of the falling of
this dust to the geological society 

 so named according to patrick symes s nomenclature 

 see encyclop of anat and physiol article cephalopoda

 mr horner and sir david brewster have described philosophical
transactions p a singular artificial substance resembling
shell it is deposited in fine transparent highly polished 
brown-coloured laminae possessing peculiar optical properties on the
inside of a vessel in which cloth first prepared with glue and then
with lime is made to revolve rapidly in water it is much softer 
more transparent and contains more animal matter than the natural
incrustation at ascension but we here again see the strong tendency
which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid
substance allied to shell

unsymmetrical web 


april th to july th a few days after our arrival i became
acquainted with an englishman who was going to visit his estate 
situated rather more than a hundred miles from the capital to the
northward of cape frio i gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing
me to accompany him 

april th our party amounted to seven the first stage was very
interesting the day was powerfully hot and as we passed through the
woods everything was motionless excepting the large and brilliant
butterflies which lazily fluttered about the view seen when crossing
the hills behind praia grande was most beautiful the colours were
intense and the prevailing tint a dark blue the sky and the calm
waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour after passing
through some cultivated country we entered a forest which in the
grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded we arrived by midday
at ithacaia this small village is situated on a plain and round the
central house are the huts of the negroes these from their regular
form and position reminded me of the drawings of the hottentot
habitations in southern africa as the moon rose early we determined
to start the same evening for our sleeping-place at the lagoa marica 
as it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive bare and
steep hills of granite which are so common in this country this spot
is notorious from having been for a long time the residence of some
runaway slaves who by cultivating a little ground near the top 
contrived to eke out a subsistence at length they were discovered 
and a party of soldiers being sent the whole were seized with the
exception of one old woman who sooner than again be led into slavery 
dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain in a roman
matron this would have been called the noble love of freedom in a poor
negress it is mere brutal obstinacy we continued riding for some
hours for the few last miles the road was intricate and it passed
through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons the scene by the dimmed
light of the moon was most desolate a few fireflies flitted by us 
and the solitary snipe as it rose uttered its plaintive cry the
distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the
night 

april th we left our miserable sleeping-place before sunrise the
road passed through a narrow sandy plain lying between the sea and the
interior salt lagoons the number of beautiful fishing birds such as
egrets and cranes and the succulent plants assuming most fantastical
forms gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have
possessed the few stunted trees were loaded with parasitical plants 
among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the orchideae
were most to be admired as the sun rose the day became extremely hot 
and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very
distressing we dined at mandetiba the thermometer in the shade being
 degs the beautiful view of the distant wooded hills reflected in
the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon quite refreshed us as
the venda here was a very good one and i have the pleasant but
rare remembrance of an excellent dinner i will be grateful and
presently describe it as the type of its class these houses are
often large and are built of thick upright posts with boughs
interwoven and afterwards plastered they seldom have floors and
never glazed windows but are generally pretty well roofed universally
the front part is open forming a kind of verandah in which tables and
benches are placed the bed-rooms join on each side and here the
passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can on a wooden platform 
covered by a thin straw mat the venda stands in a courtyard where
the horses are fed on first arriving it was our custom to unsaddle
the horses and give them their indian corn then with a low bow to
ask the senhor to do us the favour to give up something to eat 
 anything you choose sir was his usual answer for the few first
times vainly i thanked providence for having guided us to so good a
man the conversation proceeding the case universally became
deplorable any fish can you do us the favour of giving oh no 
sir any soup no sir any bread oh no sir any
dried meat oh no sir if we were lucky by waiting a couple of
hours we obtained fowls rice and farinha it not unfrequently
happened that we were obliged to kill with stones the poultry for
our own supper when thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger we
timorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal the pompous and
 though true most unsatisfactory answer was it will be ready when it
is ready if we had dared to remonstrate any further we should have
been told to proceed on our journey as being too impertinent the
hosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their manners their
houses and their persons are often filthily dirty the want of the
accommodation of forks knives and spoons is common and i am sure no
cottage or hovel in england could be found in a state so utterly
destitute of every comfort at campos novos however we fared
sumptuously having rice and fowls biscuit wine and spirits for
dinner coffee in the evening and fish with coffee for breakfast all
this with good food for the horses only cost s d per head yet
the host of this venda being asked if he knew anything of a whip which
one of the party had lost gruffly answered how should i know why
did you not take care of it i suppose the dogs have eaten it 

leaving mandetiba we continued to pass through an intricate wilderness
of lakes in some of which were fresh in others salt water shells of
the former kinds i found a limnaea in great numbers in a lake into
which the inhabitants assured me that the sea enters once a year and
sometimes oftener and makes the water quite salt i have no doubt
many interesting facts in relation to marine and fresh water animals 
might be observed in this chain of lagoons which skirt the coast of
brazil m gay has stated that he found in the neighbourhood of
rio shells of the marine genera solen and mytilus and fresh water
ampullariae living together in brackish water i also frequently
observed in the lagoon near the botanic garden where the water is only
a little less salt than in the sea a species of hydrophilus very
similar to a water-beetle common in the ditches of england in the same
lake the only shell belonged to a genus generally found in estuaries 

leaving the coast for a time we again entered the forest the trees
were very lofty and remarkable compared with those of europe from
the whiteness of their trunks i see by my note-book wonderful and
beautiful flowering parasites invariably struck me as the most novel
object in these grand scenes travelling onwards we passed through
tracts of pasturage much injured by the enormous conical ants nests 
which were nearly twelve feet high they gave to the plain exactly the
appearance of the mud volcanos at jorullo as figured by humboldt we
arrived at engenhodo after it was dark having been ten hours on
horseback i never ceased during the whole journey to be surprised
at the amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring they
appeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our
english breed the vampire bat is often the cause of much trouble by
biting the horses on their withers the injury is generally not so
much owing to the loss of blood as to the inflammation which the
pressure of the saddle afterwards produces the whole circumstance has
lately been doubted in england i was therefore fortunate in being
present when one desmodus d orbignyi wat was actually caught on a
horse s back we were bivouacking late one evening near coquimbo in
chile when my servant noticing that one of the horses was very
restive went to see what was the matter and fancying he could
distinguish something suddenly put his hand on the beast s withers 
and secured the vampire in the morning the spot where the bite had
been inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and
bloody the third day afterwards we rode the horse without any ill
effects 

april th after three days travelling we arrived at socego the
estate of senhor manuel figuireda a relation of one of our party the
house was simple and though like a barn in form was well suited to
the climate in the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly
contrasted with the whitewashed walls thatched roof and windows
without glass the house together with the granaries the stables 
and workshops for the blacks who had been taught various trades 
formed a rude kind of quadrangle in the centre of which a large pile
of coffee was drying these buildings stand on a little hill 
overlooking the cultivated ground and surrounded on every side by a
wall of dark green luxuriant forest the chief produce of this part of
the country is coffee each tree is supposed to yield annually on an
average two pounds but some give as much as eight mandioca or
cassada is likewise cultivated in great quantity every part of this
plant is useful the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses and the
roots are ground into a pulp which when pressed dry and baked forms
the farinha the principal article of sustenance in the brazils it is
a curious though well-known fact that the juice of this most
nutritious plant is highly poisonous a few years ago a cow died at
this fazenda in consequence of having drunk some of it senhor
figuireda told me that he had planted the year before one bag of
feijao or beans and three of rice the former of which produced
eighty and the latter three hundred and twenty fold the pasturage
supports a fine stock of cattle and the woods are so full of game that
a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days this
profusion of food showed itself at dinner where if the tables did not
groan the guests surely did for each person is expected to eat of
every dish one day having as i thought nicely calculated so that
nothing should go away untasted to my utter dismay a roast turkey and
a pig appeared in all their substantial reality during the meals it
was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds 
and dozens of little black children which crawled in together at
every opportunity as long as the idea of slavery could be banished 
there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and
patriarchal style of living it was such a perfect retirement and
independence from the rest of the world 

as soon as any stranger is seen arriving a large bell is set tolling 
and generally some small cannon are fired the event is thus announced
to the rocks and woods but to nothing else one morning i walked out
an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene at
last the silence was broken by the morning hymn raised on high by the
whole body of the blacks and in this manner their daily work is
generally begun on such fazendas as these i have no doubt the slaves
pass happy and contented lives on saturday and sunday they work for
themselves and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is
sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week 

april th leaving socego we rode to another estate on the rio
macae which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that direction 
the estate was two and a half miles long and the owner had forgotten
how many broad only a very small piece had been cleared yet almost
every acre was capable of yielding all the various rich productions of
a tropical land considering the enormous area of brazil the
proportion of cultivated ground can scarcely be considered as anything 
compared to that which is left in the state of nature at some future
age how vast a population it will support during the second day s
journey we found the road so shut up that it was necessary that a man
should go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers the forest
abounded with beautiful objects among which the tree ferns though not
large were from their bright green foliage and the elegant curvature
of their fronds most worthy of admiration in the evening it rained
very heavily and although the thermometer stood at degs i felt
very cold as soon as the rain ceased it was curious to observe the
extraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the
forest at the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a
dense white vapour which rose like columns of smoke from the most
thickly wooded parts and especially from the valleys i observed this
phenomenon on several occasions i suppose it is owing to the large
surface of foliage previously heated by the sun s rays 

while staying at this estate i was very nearly being an eye-witness to
one of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave
country owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit the owner was on the point
of taking all the women and children from the male slaves and selling
them separately at the public auction at rio interest and not any
feeling of compassion prevented this act indeed i do not believe
the inhumanity of separating thirty families who had lived together
for many years even occurred to the owner yet i will pledge myself 
that in humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of
men it may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest
and selfish habit i may mention one very trifling anecdote which at
the time struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty i was
crossing a ferry with a negro who was uncommonly stupid in
endeavouring to make him understand i talked loud and made signs in
doing which i passed my hand near his face he i suppose thought i
was in a passion and was going to strike him for instantly with a
frightened look and half-shut eyes he dropped his hands i shall
never forget my feelings of surprise disgust and shame at seeing a
great powerful man afraid even to ward off a blow directed as he
thought at his face this man had been trained to a degradation lower
than the slavery of the most helpless animal 

april th in returning we spent two days at socego and i employed
them in collecting insects in the forest the greater number of trees 
although so lofty are not more than three or four feet in
circumference there are of course a few of much greater dimensions 
senhor manuel was then making a canoe feet in length from a solid
trunk which had originally been feet long and of great thickness 
the contrast of palm trees growing amidst the common branching kinds 
never fails to give the scene an intertropical character here the
woods were ornamented by the cabbage palm one of the most beautiful of
its family with a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the
two hands it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty
feet above the ground the woody creepers themselves covered by other
creepers were of great thickness some which i measured were two feet
in circumference many of the older trees presented a very curious
appearance from the tresses of a liana hanging from their boughs and
resembling bundles of hay if the eye was turned from the world of
foliage above to the ground beneath it was attracted by the extreme
elegance of the leaves of the ferns and mimosae the latter in some
parts covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high in
walking across these thick beds of mimosae a broad track was marked by
the change of shade produced by the drooping of their sensitive
petioles it is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in
these grand scenes but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of
the higher feelings of wonder astonishment and devotion which fill
and elevate the mind 

april th leaving socego during the two first days we retraced our
steps it was very wearisome work as the road generally ran across a
glaring hot sandy plain not far from the coast i noticed that each
time the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand a gentle
chirping noise was produced on the third day we took a different
line and passed through the gay little village of madre de deos this
is one of the principal lines of road in brazil yet it was in so bad a
state that no wheeled vehicle excepting the clumsy bullock-wagon 
could pass along in our whole journey we did not cross a single
bridge built of stone and those made of logs of wood were frequently
so much out of repair that it was necessary to go on one side to avoid
them all distances are inaccurately known the road is often marked
by crosses in the place of milestones to signify where human blood
has been spilled on the evening of the rd we arrived at rio having
finished our pleasant little excursion 

during the remainder of my stay at rio i resided in a cottage at
botofogo bay it was impossible to wish for anything more delightful
than thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country in england
any person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great
advantage by always having something to attract his attention but in
these fertile climates teeming with life the attractions are so
numerous that he is scarcely able to walk at all 

the few observations which i was enabled to make were almost
exclusively confined to the invertebrate animals the existence of a
division of the genus planaria which inhabits the dry land interested
me much these animals are of so simple a structure that cuvier has
arranged them with the intestinal worms though never found within the
bodies of other animals numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh
water but those to which i allude were found even in the drier parts
of the forest beneath logs of rotten wood on which i believe they
feed in general form they resemble little slugs but are very much
narrower in proportion and several of the species are beautifully
coloured with longitudinal stripes their structure is very simple 
near the middle of the under or crawling surface there are two small
transverse slits from the anterior one of which a funnel-shaped and
highly irritable mouth can be protruded for some time after the rest
of the animal was completely dead from the effects of salt water or any
other cause this organ still retained its vitality 

i found no less than twelve different species of terrestrial planariae
in different parts of the southern hemisphere some specimens which
i obtained at van dieman s land i kept alive for nearly two months 
feeding them on rotten wood having cut one of them transversely into
two nearly equal parts in the course of a fortnight both had the shape
of perfect animals i had however so divided the body that one of
the halves contained both the inferior orifices and the other in
consequence none in the course of twenty-five days from the
operation the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from
any other specimen the other had increased much in size and towards
its posterior end a clear space was formed in the parenchymatous mass 
in which a rudimentary cup-shaped mouth could clearly be distinguished 
on the under surface however no corresponding slit was yet open if
the increased heat of the weather as we approached the equator had
not destroyed all the individuals there can be no doubt that this last
step would have completed its structure although so well-known an
experiment it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every
essential organ out of the simple extremity of another animal it is
extremely difficult to preserve these planariae as soon as the
cessation of life allows the ordinary laws of change to act their
entire bodies become soft and fluid with a rapidity which i have never
seen equalled 

i first visited the forest in which these planariae were found in
company with an old portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him 
the sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs and then
patiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear we were
accompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmer a good specimen of a
wild brazilian youth he was dressed in a tattered old shirt and
trousers and had his head uncovered he carried an old-fashioned gun
and a large knife the habit of carrying the knife is universal and
in traversing a thick wood it is almost necessary on account of the
creeping plants the frequent occurrence of murder may be partly
attributed to this habit the brazilians are so dexterous with the
knife that they can throw it to some distance with precision and with
sufficient force to cause a fatal wound i have seen a number of
little boys practising this art as a game of play and from their skill
in hitting an upright stick they promised well for more earnest
attempts my companion the day before had shot two large bearded
monkeys these animals have prehensile tails the extremity of which 
even after death can support the whole weight of the body one of
them thus remained fast to a branch and it was necessary to cut down a
large tree to procure it this was soon effected and down came tree
and monkey with an awful crash our day s sport besides the monkey 
was confined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans i
profited however by my acquaintance with the portuguese padre for on
another occasion he gave me a fine specimen of the yagouaroundi cat 

every one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near botofogo the
house in which i lived was seated close beneath the well-known mountain
of the corcovado it has been remarked with much truth that abruptly
conical hills are characteristic of the formation which humboldt
designates as gneiss-granite nothing can be more striking than the
effect of these huge rounded masses of naked rock rising out of the
most luxuriant vegetation 

i was often interested by watching the clouds which rolling in from
seaward formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the corcovado 
this mountain like most others when thus partly veiled appeared to
rise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of feet mr 
daniell has observed in his meteorological essays that a cloud
sometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit while the wind continues
to blow over it the same phenomenon here presented a slightly
different appearance in this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl
over and rapidly pass by the summit and yet was neither diminished
nor increased in size the sun was setting and a gentle southerly
breeze striking against the southern side of the rock mingled its
current with the colder air above and the vapour was thus condensed 
but as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge and came
within the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping
bank they were immediately re-dissolved 

the climate during the months of may and june or the beginning of
winter was delightful the mean temperature from observations taken
at nine o clock both morning and evening was only degs it often
rained heavily but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the
walks pleasant one morning in the course of six hours inches of
rain fell as this storm passed over the forests which surround the
corcovado the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless
multitude of leaves was very remarkable it could be heard at the
distance of a quarter of a mile and was like the rushing of a great
body of water after the hotter days it was delicious to sit quietly
in the garden and watch the evening pass into night nature in these
climes chooses her vocalists from more humble performers than in
europe a small frog of the genus hyla sits on a blade of grass
about an inch above the surface of the water and sends forth a
pleasing chirp when several are together they sing in harmony on
different notes i had some difficulty in catching a specimen of this
frog the genus hyla has its toes terminated by small suckers and i
found this animal could crawl up a pane of glass when placed
absolutely perpendicular various cicidae and crickets at the same
time keep up a ceaseless shrill cry but which softened by the
distance is not unpleasant every evening after dark this great
concert commenced and often have i sat listening to it until my
attention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect 

at these times the fireflies are seen flitting about from hedge to
hedge on a dark night the light can be seen at about two hundred
paces distant it is remarkable that in all the different kinds of
glowworms shining elaters and various marine animals such as the
crustacea medusae nereidae a coralline of the genus clytia and
pyrosma which i have observed the light has been of a well-marked
green colour all the fireflies which i caught here belonged to the
lampyridae in which family the english glowworm is included and the
greater number of specimens were of lampyris occidentalis i found
that this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated in
the intervals the abdominal rings were obscured the flash was almost
co-instantaneous in the two rings but it was just perceptible first in
the anterior one the shining matter was fluid and very adhesive 
little spots where the skin had been torn continued bright with a
slight scintillation whilst the uninjured parts were obscured when
the insect was decapitated the rings remained uninterruptedly bright 
but not so brilliant as before local irritation with a needle always
increased the vividness of the light the rings in one instance
retained their luminous property nearly twenty-four hours after the
death of the insect from these facts it would appear probable that
the animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light
for short intervals and that at other times the display is
involuntary on the muddy and wet gravel-walks i found the larvae of
this lampyris in great numbers they resembled in general form the
female of the english glowworm these larvae possessed but feeble
luminous powers very differently from their parents on the slightest
touch they feigned death and ceased to shine nor did irritation excite
any fresh display i kept several of them alive for some time their
tails are very singular organs for they act by a well-fitted
contrivance as suckers or organs of attachment and likewise as
reservoirs for saliva or some such fluid i repeatedly fed them on
raw meat and i invariably observed that every now and then the
extremity of the tail was applied to the mouth and a drop of fluid
exuded on the meat which was then in the act of being consumed the
tail notwithstanding so much practice does not seem to be able to
find its way to the mouth at least the neck was always touched first 
and apparently as a guide 

when we were at bahia an elater or beetle pyrophorus luminosus 
illig seemed the most common luminous insect the light in this case
was also rendered more brilliant by irritation i amused myself one
day by observing the springing powers of this insect which have not 
as it appears to me been properly described the elater when
placed on its back and preparing to spring moved its head and thorax
backwards so that the pectoral spine was drawn out and rested on the
edge of its sheath the same backward movement being continued the
spine by the full action of the muscles was bent like a spring and
the insect at this moment rested on the extremity of its head and
wing-cases the effort being suddenly relaxed the head and thorax flew
up and in consequence the base of the wing-cases struck the
supporting surface with such force that the insect by the reaction was
jerked upwards to the height of one or two inches the projecting
points of the thorax and the sheath of the spine served to steady the
whole body during the spring in the descriptions which i have read 
sufficient stress does not appear to have been laid on the elasticity
of the spine so sudden a spring could not be the result of simple
muscular contraction without the aid of some mechanical contrivance 

on several occasions i enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions
in the neighbouring country one day i went to the botanic garden 
where many plants well known for their great utility might be seen
growing the leaves of the camphor pepper cinnamon and clove trees
were delightfully aromatic and the bread-fruit the jaca and the
mango vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage the
landscape in the neighbourhood of bahia almost takes its character from
the two latter trees before seeing them i had no idea that any trees
could cast so black a shade on the ground both of them bear to the
evergreen vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation which
laurels and hollies in england do to the lighter green of the deciduous
trees it may be observed that the houses within the tropics are
surrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation because many of
them are at the same time most useful to man who can doubt that these
qualities are united in the banana the cocoa-nut the many kinds of
palm the orange and the bread-fruit tree 

during this day i was particularly struck with a remark of humboldt s 
who often alludes to the thin vapour which without changing the
transparency of the air renders its tints more harmonious and softens
its effects this is an appearance which i have never observed in the
temperate zones the atmosphere seen through a short space of half or
three-quarters of a mile was perfectly lucid but at a greater
distance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze of a pale
french grey mingled with a little blue the condition of the
atmosphere between the morning and about noon when the effect was most
evident had undergone little change excepting in its dryness in the
interval the difference between the dew point and temperature had
increased from to degs 

on another occasion i started early and walked to the gavia or topsail
mountain the air was delightfully cool and fragrant and the drops of
dew still glittered on the leaves of the large liliaceous plants which
shaded the streamlets of clear water sitting down on a block of
granite it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as
they flew past the humming-bird seems particularly fond of such shady
retired spots whenever i saw these little creatures buzzing round a
flower with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely
visible i was reminded of the sphinx moths their movements and habits
are indeed in many respects very similar 

following a pathway i entered a noble forest and from a height of
five or six hundred feet one of those splendid views was presented 
which are so common on every side of rio at this elevation the
landscape attains its most brilliant tint and every form every shade 
so completely surpasses in magnificence all that the european has ever
beheld in his own country that he knows not how to express his
feelings the general effect frequently recalled to my mind the gayest
scenery of the opera-house or the great theatres i never returned
from these excursions empty-handed this day i found a specimen of a
curious fungus called hymenophallus most people know the english
phallus which in autumn taints the air with its odious smell this 
however as the entomologist is aware is to some of our beetles a
delightful fragrance so was it here for a strongylus attracted by
the odour alighted on the fungus as i carried it in my hand we here
see in two distant countries a similar relation between plants and
insects of the same families though the species of both are different 
when man is the agent in introducing into a country a new species this
relation is often broken as one instance of this i may mention that
the leaves of the cabbages and lettuces which in england afford food
to such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars in the gardens near rio
are untouched 

during our stay at brazil i made a large collection of insects a few
general observations on the comparative importance of the different
orders may be interesting to the english entomologist the large and
brilliantly coloured lepidoptera bespeak the zone they inhabit far
more plainly than any other race of animals i allude only to the
butterflies for the moths contrary to what might have been expected
from the rankness of the vegetation certainly appeared in much fewer
numbers than in our own temperate regions i was much surprised at the
habits of papilio feronia this butterfly is not uncommon and
generally frequents the orange-groves although a high flier yet it
very frequently alights on the trunks of trees on these occasions its
head is invariably placed downwards and its wings are expanded in a
horizontal plane instead of being folded vertically as is commonly
the case this is the only butterfly which i have ever seen that uses
its legs for running not being aware of this fact the insect more
than once as i cautiously approached with my forceps shuffled on one
side just as the instrument was on the point of closing and thus
escaped but a far more singular fact is the power which this species
possesses of making a noise several times when a pair probably
male and female were chasing each other in an irregular course they
passed within a few yards of me and i distinctly heard a clicking
noise similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a
spring catch the noise was continued at short intervals and could be
distinguished at about twenty yards distance i am certain there is no
error in the observation 

i was disappointed in the general aspect of the coleoptera the number
of minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great the
cabinets of europe can as yet boast only of the larger species from
tropical climates it is sufficient to disturb the composure of an
entomologist s mind to look forward to the future dimensions of a
complete catalogue the carnivorous beetles or carabidae appear in
extremely few numbers within the tropics this is the more remarkable
when compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds which are so
abundant in hot countries i was struck with this observation both on
entering brazil and when i saw the many elegant and active forms of
the harpalidae re-appearing on the temperate plains of la plata do
the very numerous spiders and rapacious hymenoptera supply the place of
the carnivorous beetles the carrion-feeders and brachelytra are very
uncommon on the other hand the rhyncophora and chrysomelidae all of
which depend on the vegetable world for subsistence are present in
astonishing numbers i do not here refer to the number of different
species but to that of the individual insects for on this it is that
the most striking character in the entomology of different countries
depends the orders orthoptera and hemiptera are particularly
numerous as likewise is the stinging division of the hymenoptera the
bees perhaps being excepted a person on first entering a tropical
forest is astonished at the labours of the ants well-beaten paths
branch off in every direction on which an army of never-failing
foragers may be seen some going forth and others returning burdened
with pieces of green leaf often larger than their own bodies 

a small dark-coloured ant sometimes migrates in countless numbers one
day at bahia my attention was drawn by observing many spiders 
cockroaches and other insects and some lizards rushing in the
greatest agitation across a bare piece of ground a little way behind 
every stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant the swarm having
crossed the bare space divided itself and descended an old wall by
this means many insects were fairly enclosed and the efforts which the
poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death
were wonderful when the ants came to the road they changed their
course and in narrow files reascended the wall having placed a small
stone so as to intercept one of the lines the whole body attacked it 
and then immediately retired shortly afterwards another body came to
the charge and again having failed to make any impression this line
of march was entirely given up by going an inch round the file might
have avoided the stone and this doubtless would have happened if it
had been originally there but having been attacked the lion-hearted
little warriors scorned the idea of yielding 

certain wasp-like insects which construct in the corners of the
verandahs clay cells for their larvae are very numerous in the
neighbourhood of rio these cells they stuff full of half-dead spiders
and caterpillars which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to
that degree as to leave them paralysed but alive until their eggs are
hatched and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless 
half-killed victims a sight which has been described by an
enthusiastic naturalist as curious and pleasing i was much
interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a pepsis and a
large spider of the genus lycosa the wasp made a sudden dash at its
prey and then flew away the spider was evidently wounded for trying
to escape it rolled down a little slope but had still strength
sufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass the wasp soon
returned and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim 
it then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox making
short semicircular casts and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings
and antennae the spider though well concealed was soon discovered 
and the wasp evidently still afraid of its adversary s jaws after
much manoeuvring inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax 
at last carefully examining with its antennae the now motionless
spider it proceeded to drag away the body but i stopped both tyrant
and prey 

the number of spiders in proportion to other insects is here compared
with england very much larger perhaps more so than with any other
division of the articulate animals the variety of species among the
jumping spiders appears almost infinite the genus or rather family 
of epeira is here characterized by many singular forms some species
have pointed coriaceous shells others enlarged and spiny tibiae every
path in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a
species belonging to the same division with the epeira clavipes of
fabricius which was formerly said by sloane to make in the west
indies webs so strong as to catch birds a small and pretty kind of
spider with very long fore-legs and which appears to belong to an
undescribed genus lives as a parasite on almost every one of these
webs i suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the great
epeira and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects which 
adhering to the lines would otherwise be wasted when frightened 
this little spider either feigns death by extending its front legs or
suddenly drops from the web a large epeira of the same division with
epeira tuberculata and conica is extremely common especially in dry
situations its web which is generally placed among the great leaves
of the common agave is sometimes strengthened near the centre by a
pair or even four zigzag ribbons which connect two adjoining rays 
when any large insect as a grasshopper or wasp is caught the spider 
by a dexterous movement makes it revolve very rapidly and at the same
time emitting a band of threads from its spinners soon envelops its
prey in a case like the cocoon of a silkworm the spider now examines
the powerless victim and gives the fatal bite on the hinder part of
its thorax then retreating patiently waits till the poison has taken
effect the virulence of this poison may be judged of from the fact
that in half a minute i opened the mesh and found a large wasp quite
lifeless this epeira always stands with its head downwards near the
centre of the web when disturbed it acts differently according to
circumstances if there is a thicket below it suddenly falls down and
i have distinctly seen the thread from the spinners lengthened by the
animal while yet stationary as preparatory to its fall if the ground
is clear beneath the epeira seldom falls but moves quickly through a
central passage from one to the other side when still further
disturbed it practises a most curious manoeuvre standing in the
middle it violently jerks the web which it attached to elastic twigs 
till at last the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement that
even the outline of the spider s body becomes indistinct 

it is well known that most of the british spiders when a large insect
is caught in their webs endeavour to cut the lines and liberate their
prey to save their nets from being entirely spoiled i once however 
saw in a hothouse in shropshire a large female wasp caught in the
irregular web of a quite small spider and this spider instead of
cutting the web most perseveringly continued to entangle the body and
especially the wings of its prey the wasp at first aimed in vain
repeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist pitying the
wasp after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour i killed it
and put it back into the web the spider soon returned and an hour
afterwards i was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the
orifice through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp i
drove the spider away two or three times but for the next twenty-four
hours i always found it again sucking at the same place the spider
became much distended by the juices of its prey which was many times
larger than itself 

i may here just mention that i found near st fe bajada many large
black spiders with ruby-coloured marks on their backs having
gregarious habits the webs were placed vertically as is invariably
the case with the genus epeira they were separated from each other by
a space of about two feet but were all attached to certain common
lines which were of great length and extended to all parts of the
community in this manner the tops of some large bushes were
encompassed by the united nets azara has described a gregarious
spider in paraguay which walckanaer thinks must be a theridion but
probably it is an epeira and perhaps even the same species with mine 
i cannot however recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat 
in which during autumn when the spiders die azara says the eggs are
deposited as all the spiders which i saw were of the same size they
must have been nearly of the same age this gregarious habit in so
typical a genus as epeira among insects which are so bloodthirsty and
solitary that even the two sexes attack each other is a very singular
fact 

in a lofty valley of the cordillera near mendoza i found another
spider with a singularly-formed web strong lines radiated in a
vertical plane from a common centre where the insect had its station 
but only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical mesh-work so
that the net instead of being as is generally the case circular 
consisted of a wedge-shaped segment all the webs were similarly
constructed

lightning house struck 


july th in the morning we got under way and stood out of the
splendid harbour of rio de janeiro in our passage to the plata we
saw nothing particular excepting on one day a great shoal of
porpoises many hundreds in number the whole sea was in places
furrowed by them and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented as
hundreds proceeding together by jumps in which their whole bodies
were exposed thus cut the water when the ship was running nine knots
an hour these animals could cross and recross the bows with the
greatest of ease and then dash away right ahead as soon as we
entered the estuary of the plata the weather was very unsettled one
dark night we were surrounded by numerous seals and penguins which
made such strange noises that the officer on watch reported he could
hear the cattle bellowing on shore on a second night we witnessed a
splendid scene of natural fireworks the mast-head and yard-arm-ends
shone with st elmo s light and the form of the vane could almost be
traced as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus the sea was so
highly luminous that the tracks of the penguins were marked by a fiery
wake and the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the
most vivid lightning 

when within the mouth of the river i was interested by observing how
slowly the waters of the sea and river mixed the latter muddy and
discoloured from its less specific gravity floated on the surface of
the salt water this was curiously exhibited in the wake of the
vessel where a line of blue water was seen mingling in little eddies 
with the adjoining fluid 

july th we anchored at monte video the beagle was employed in
surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of america south of
the plata during the two succeeding years to prevent useless
repetitions i will extract those parts of my journal which refer to
the same districts without always attending to the order in which we
visited them 

maldonado is situated on the northern bank of the plata and not very
far from the mouth of the estuary it is a most quiet forlorn little
town built as is universally the case in these countries with the
streets running at right angles to each other and having in the middle
a large plaza or square which from its size renders the scantiness
of the population more evident it possesses scarcely any trade the
exports being confined to a few hides and living cattle the
inhabitants are chiefly landowners together with a few shopkeepers and
the necessary tradesmen such as blacksmiths and carpenters who do
nearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round the town
is separated from the river by a band of sand-hillocks about a mile
broad it is surrounded on all other sides by an open
slightly-undulating country covered by one uniform layer of fine green
turf on which countless herds of cattle sheep and horses graze 
there is very little land cultivated even close to the town a few
hedges made of cacti and agave mark out where some wheat or indian
corn has been planted the features of the country are very similar
along the whole northern bank of the plata the only difference is 
that here the granitic hills are a little bolder the scenery is very
uninteresting there is scarcely a house an enclosed piece of ground 
or even a tree to give it an air of cheerfulness yet after being
imprisoned for some time in a ship there is a charm in the unconfined
feeling of walking over boundless plains of turf moreover if your
view is limited to a small space many objects possess beauty some of
the smaller birds are brilliantly coloured and the bright green sward 
browsed short by the cattle is ornamented by dwarf flowers among
which a plant looking like the daisy claimed the place of an old
friend what would a florist say to whole tracts so thickly covered
by the verbena melindres as even at a distance to appear of the most
gaudy scarlet 

i stayed ten weeks at maldonado in which time a nearly perfect
collection of the animals birds and reptiles was procured before
making any observations respecting them i will give an account of a
little excursion i made as far as the river polanco which is about
seventy miles distant in a northerly direction i may mention as a
proof how cheap everything is in this country that i paid only two
dollars a day or eight shillings for two men together with a troop
of about a dozen riding-horses my companions were well armed with
pistols and sabres a precaution which i thought rather unnecessary but
the first piece of news we heard was that the day before a traveller
from monte video had been found dead on the road with his throat cut 
this happened close to a cross the record of a former murder 

on the first night we slept at a retired little country-house and
there i soon found out that i possessed two or three articles 
especially a pocket compass which created unbounded astonishment in
every house i was asked to show the compass and by its aid together
with a map to point out the direction of various places it excited
the liveliest admiration that i a perfect stranger should know the
road for direction and road are synonymous in this open country to
places where i had never been at one house a young woman who was ill
in bed sent to entreat me to come and show her the compass if their
surprise was great mine was greater to find such ignorance among
people who possessed their thousands of cattle and estancias of
great extent it can only be accounted for by the circumstance that
this retired part of the country is seldom visited by foreigners i
was asked whether the earth or sun moved whether it was hotter or
colder to the north where spain was and many other such questions 
the greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that
england london and north america were different names for the same
place but the better informed well knew that london and north america
were separate countries close together and that england was a large
town in london i carried with me some promethean matches which i
ignited by biting it was thought so wonderful that a man should strike
fire with his teeth that it was usual to collect the whole family to
see it i was once offered a dollar for a single one washing my face
in the morning caused much speculation at the village of las minas a
superior tradesman closely cross-questioned me about so singular a
practice and likewise why on board we wore our beards for he had
heard from my guide that we did so he eyed me with much suspicion 
perhaps he had heard of ablutions in the mahomedan religion and
knowing me to be a heretick probably he came to the conclusion that
all hereticks were turks it is the general custom in this country to
ask for a night s lodging at the first convenient house the
astonishment at the compass and my other feats of jugglery was to a
certain degree advantageous as with that and the long stories my
guides told of my breaking stones knowing venomous from harmless
snakes collecting insects etc i repaid them for their hospitality 
i am writing as if i had been among the inhabitants of central africa 
banda oriental would not be flattered by the comparison but such were
my feelings at the time 

the next day we rode to the village of las minas the country was
rather more hilly but otherwise continued the same an inhabitant of
the pampas no doubt would have considered it as truly alpine the
country is so thinly inhabited that during the whole day we scarcely
met a single person las minas is much smaller even than maldonado it
is seated on a little plain and is surrounded by low rocky mountains 
it is of the usual symmetrical form and with its whitewashed church
standing in the centre had rather a pretty appearance the
outskirting houses rose out of the plain like isolated beings without
the accompaniment of gardens or courtyards this is generally the case
in the country and all the houses have in consequence an
uncomfortable aspect at night we stopped at a pulperia or
drinking-shop during the evening a great number of gauchos came in to
drink spirits and smoke cigars their appearance is very striking they
are generally tall and handsome but with a proud and dissolute
expression of countenance they frequently wear their moustaches and
long black hair curling down their backs with their brightly coloured
garments great spurs clanking about their heels and knives stuck as
daggers and often so used at their waists they look a very different
race of men from what might be expected from their name of gauchos or
simple countrymen their politeness is excessive they never drink
their spirits without expecting you to taste it but whilst making
their exceedingly graceful bow they seem quite as ready if occasion
offered to cut your throat 

on the third day we pursued rather an irregular course as i was
employed in examining some beds of marble on the fine plains of turf
we saw many ostriches struthio rhea some of the flocks contained as
many as twenty or thirty birds these when standing on any little
eminence and seen against the clear sky presented a very noble
appearance i never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of
the country it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them 
but then expanding their wings they made all sail right before the
wind and soon left the horse astern 

at night we came to the house of don juan fuentes a rich landed
proprietor but not personally known to either of my companions on
approaching the house of a stranger it is usual to follow several
little points of etiquette riding up slowly to the door the
salutation of ave maria is given and until somebody comes out and asks
you to alight it is not customary even to get off your horse the
formal answer of the owner is sin pecado concebida that is 
conceived without sin having entered the house some general
conversation is kept up for a few minutes till permission is asked to
pass the night there this is granted as a matter of course the
stranger then takes his meals with the family and a room is assigned
him where with the horsecloths belonging to his recado or saddle of
the pampas he makes his bed it is curious how similar circumstances
produce such similar results in manners at the cape of good hope the
same hospitality and very nearly the same points of etiquette are
universally observed the difference however between the character
of the spaniard and that of the dutch boer is shown by the former
never asking his guest a single question beyond the strictest rule of
politeness whilst the honest dutchman demands where he has been where
he is going what is his business and even how many brothers sisters 
or children he may happen to have 

shortly after our arrival at don juan s one of the largest herds of
cattle was driven in towards the house and three beasts were picked
out to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment these
half-wild cattle are very active and knowing full well the fatal lazo 
they led the horses a long and laborious chase after witnessing the
rude wealth displayed in the number of cattle men and horses don
juan s miserable house was quite curious the floor consisted of
hardened mud and the windows were without glass the sitting-room
boasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools with a couple
of tables the supper although several strangers were present 
consisted of two huge piles one of roast beef the other of boiled 
with some pieces of pumpkin besides this latter there was no other
vegetable and not even a morsel of bread for drinking a large
earthenware jug of water served the whole party yet this man was the
owner of several square miles of land of which nearly every acre would
produce corn and with a little trouble all the common vegetables 
the evening was spent in smoking with a little impromptu singing 
accompanied by the guitar the signoritas all sat together in one
corner of the room and did not sup with the men 

so many works have been written about these countries that it is
almost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas the lazo
consists of a very strong but thin well-plaited rope made of raw
hide one end is attached to the broad surcingle which fastens
together the complicated gear of the recado or saddle used in the
pampas the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass by
which a noose can be formed the gaucho when he is going to use the
lazo keeps a small coil in his bridle-hand and in the other holds the
running noose which is made very large generally having a diameter of
about eight feet this he whirls round his head and by the dexterous
movement of his wrist keeps the noose open then throwing it he
causes it to fall on any particular spot he chooses the lazo when
not used is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the recado 
the bolas or balls are of two kinds the simplest which is chiefly
used for catching ostriches consists of two round stones covered with
leather and united by a thin plaited thong about eight feet long the
other kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a
common centre the gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand 
and whirls the other two round and round his head then taking aim 
sends them like chain shot revolving through the air the balls no
sooner strike any object than winding round it they cross each
other and become firmly hitched the size and weight of the balls
vary according to the purpose for which they are made when of stone 
although not larger than an apple they are sent with such force as
sometimes to break the leg even of a horse i have seen the balls made
of wood and as large as a turnip for the sake of catching these
animals without injuring them the balls are sometimes made of iron 
and these can be hurled to the greatest distance the main difficulty
in using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full
speed and while suddenly turning about to whirl them so steadily
round the head as to take aim on foot any person would soon learn the
art one day as i was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the
balls round my head by accident the free one struck a bush and its
revolving motion being thus destroyed it immediately fell to the
ground and like magic caught one hind leg of my horse the other
ball was then jerked out of my hand and the horse fairly secured 
luckily he was an old practised animal and knew what it meant 
otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself
down the gauchos roared with laughter they cried out that they had
seen every sort of animal caught but had never before seen a man
caught by himself 

during the two succeeding days i reached the furthest point which i
was anxious to examine the country wore the same aspect till at last
the fine green turf became more wearisome than a dusty turnpike road 
we everywhere saw great numbers of partridges nothura major these
birds do not go in coveys nor do they conceal themselves like the
english kind it appears a very silly bird a man on horseback by
riding round and round in a circle or rather in a spire so as to
approach closer each time may knock on the head as many as he pleases 
the more common method is to catch them with a running noose or little
lazo made of the stem of an ostrich s feather fastened to the end of
a long stick a boy on a quiet old horse will frequently thus catch
thirty or forty in a day in arctic north america the indians
catch the varying hare by walking spirally round and round it when on
its form the middle of the day is reckoned the best time when the sun
is high and the shadow of the hunter not very long 

on our return to maldonado we followed rather a different line of
road near pan de azucar a landmark well known to all those who have
sailed up the plata i stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable
old spaniard early in the morning we ascended the sierra de las
animas by the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost
picturesque to the westward the view extended over an immense level
plain as far as the mount at monte video and to the eastward over
the mammillated country of maldonado on the summit of the mountain
there were several small heaps of stones which evidently had lain
there for many years my companion assured me that they were the work
of the indians in the old time the heaps were similar but on a much
smaller scale to those so commonly found on the mountains of wales 
the desire to signalize any event on the highest point of the
neighbouring land seems an universal passion with mankind at the
present day not a single indian either civilized or wild exists in
this part of the province nor am i aware that the former inhabitants
have left behind them any more permanent records than these
insignificant piles on the summit of the sierra de las animas 


the general and almost entire absence of trees in banda oriental is
remarkable some of the rocky hills are partly covered by thickets 
and on the banks of the larger streams especially to the north of las
minas willow-trees are not uncommon near the arroyo tapes i heard of
a wood of palms and one of these trees of considerable size i saw
near the pan de azucar in lat degs these and the trees planted
by the spaniards offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of
wood among the introduced kinds may be enumerated poplars olives 
peach and other fruit trees the peaches succeed so well that they
afford the main supply of firewood to the city of buenos ayres 
extremely level countries such as the pampas seldom appear favourable
to the growth of trees this may possibly be attributed either to the
force of the winds or the kind of drainage in the nature of the
land however around maldonado no such reason is apparent the rocky
mountains afford protected situations enjoying various kinds of soil 
streamlets of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley 
and the clayey nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture it
has been inferred with much probability that the presence of woodland
is generally determined by the annual amount of moisture yet in
this province abundant and heavy rain falls during the winter and the
summer though dry is not so in any excessive degree we see
nearly the whole of australia covered by lofty trees yet that country
possesses a far more arid climate hence we must look to some other
and unknown cause 

confining our view to south america we should certainly be tempted to
believe that trees flourished only under a very humid climate for the
limit of the forest-land follows in a most remarkable manner that of
the damp winds in the southern part of the continent where the
western gales charged with moisture from the pacific prevail every
island on the broken west coast from lat degs to the extreme
point of tierra del fuego is densely covered by impenetrable forests 
on the eastern side of the cordillera over the same extent of
latitude where a blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere
has been deprived of its moisture by passing over the mountains the
arid plains of patagonia support a most scanty vegetation in the more
northern parts of the continent within the limits of the constant
south-eastern trade-wind the eastern side is ornamented by magnificent
forests whilst the western coast from lat degs s to lat 
degs s may be described as a desert on this western coast 
northward of lat degs s where the trade-wind loses its
regularity and heavy torrents of rain fall periodically the shores of
the pacific so utterly desert in peru assume near cape blanco the
character of luxuriance so celebrated at guyaquil and panama hence in
the southern and northern parts of the continent the forest and desert
lands occupy reversed positions with respect to the cordillera and
these positions are apparently determined by the direction of the
prevalent winds in the middle of the continent there is a broad
intermediate band including central chile and the provinces of la
plata where the rain-bringing winds have not to pass over lofty
mountains and where the land is neither a desert nor covered by
forests but even the rule if confined to south america of trees
flourishing only in a climate rendered humid by rain-bearing winds has
a strongly marked exception in the case of the falkland islands these
islands situated in the same latitude with tierra del fuego and only
between two and three hundred miles distant from it having a nearly
similar climate with a geological formation almost identical with
favourable situations and the same kind of peaty soil yet can boast of
few plants deserving even the title of bushes whilst in tierra del
fuego it is impossible to find an acre of land not covered by the
densest forest in this case both the direction of the heavy gales of
wind and of the currents of the sea are favourable to the transport of
seeds from tierra del fuego as is shown by the canoes and trunks of
trees drifted from that country and frequently thrown on the shores of
the western falkland hence perhaps it is that there are many plants
in common to the two countries but with respect to the trees of tierra
del fuego even attempts made to transplant them have failed 

during our stay at maldonado i collected several quadrupeds eighty
kinds of birds and many reptiles including nine species of snakes of
the indigenous mammalia the only one now left of any size which is
common is the cervus campestris this deer is exceedingly abundant 
often in small herds throughout the countries bordering the plata and
in northern patagonia if a person crawling close along the ground 
slowly advances towards a herd the deer frequently out of curiosity 
approach to reconnoitre him i have by this means killed from one
spot three out of the same herd although so tame and inquisitive 
yet when approached on horseback they are exceedingly wary in this
country nobody goes on foot and the deer knows man as its enemy only
when he is mounted and armed with the bolas at bahia blanca a recent
establishment in northern patagonia i was surprised to find how little
the deer cared for the noise of a gun one day i fired ten times from
within eighty yards at one animal and it was much more startled at the
ball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle my powder
being exhausted i was obliged to get up to my shame as a sportsman be
it spoken though well able to kill birds on the wing and halloo till
the deer ran away 

the most curious fact with respect to this animal is the
overpoweringly strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck 
it is quite indescribable several times whilst skinning the specimen
which is now mounted at the zoological museum i was almost overcome by
nausea i tied up the skin in a silk pocket-handkerchief and so
carried it home this handkerchief after being well washed i
continually used and it was of course as repeatedly washed yet every
time for a space of one year and seven months when first unfolded i
distinctly perceived the odour this appears an astonishing instance
of the permanence of some matter which nevertheless in its nature must
be most subtile and volatile frequently when passing at the distance
of half a mile to leeward of a herd i have perceived the whole air
tainted with the effluvium i believe the smell from the buck is most
powerful at the period when its horns are perfect or free from the
hairy skin when in this state the meat is of course quite
uneatable but the gauchos assert that if buried for some time in
fresh earth the taint is removed i have somewhere read that the
islanders in the north of scotland treat the rank carcasses of the
fish-eating birds in the same manner 

the order rodentia is here very numerous in species of mice alone i
obtained no less than eight kinds the largest gnawing animal in
the world the hydrochaerus capybara the water-hog is here also
common one which i shot at monte video weighed ninety-eight pounds 
its length from the end of the snout to the stump-like tail was three
feet two inches and its girth three feet eight these great rodents
occasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the plata where the
water is quite salt but are far more abundant on the borders of
fresh-water lakes and rivers near maldonado three or four generally
live together in the daytime they either lie among the aquatic
plants or openly feed on the turf plain when viewed at a
distance from their manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs 
but when seated on their haunches and attentively watching any object
with one eye they reassume the appearance of their congeners cavies
and rabbits both the front and side view of their head has quite a
ludicrous aspect from the great depth of their jaw these animals at
maldonado were very tame by cautiously walking i approached within
three yards of four old ones this tameness may probably be accounted
for by the jaguar having been banished for some years and by the
gaucho not thinking it worth his while to hunt them as i approached
nearer and nearer they frequently made their peculiar noise which is a
low abrupt grunt not having much actual sound but rather arising from
the sudden expulsion of air the only noise i know at all like it is
the first hoarse bark of a large dog having watched the four from
almost within arm s length and they me for several minutes they
rushed into the water at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity and
emitted at the same time their bark after diving a short distance
they came again to the surface but only just showed the upper part of
their heads when the female is swimming in the water and has young
ones they are said to sit on her back these animals are easily killed
in numbers but their skins are of trifling value and the meat is very
indifferent on the islands in the rio parana they are exceedingly
abundant and afford the ordinary prey to the jaguar 

the tucutuco ctenomys brasiliensis is a curious small animal which
may be briefly described as a gnawer with the habits of a mole it is
extremely numerous in some parts of the country but it is difficult to
be procured and never i believe comes out of the ground it throws
up at the mouth of its burrows hillocks of earth like those of the
mole but smaller considerable tracts of country are so completely
undermined by these animals that horses in passing over sink above
their fetlocks the tucutucos appear to a certain degree to be
gregarious the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six
together and he said this was a common occurrence they are nocturnal
in their habits and their principal food is the roots of plants which
are the object of their extensive and superficial burrows this animal
is universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when
beneath the ground a person the first time he hears it is much
surprised for it is not easy to tell whence it comes nor is it
possible to guess what kind of creature utters it the noise consists
in a short but not rough nasal grunt which is monotonously repeated
about four times in quick succession the name tucutuco is given in
imitation of the sound where this animal is abundant it may be heard
at all times of the day and sometimes directly beneath one s feet 
when kept in a room the tucutucos move both slowly and clumsily which
appears owing to the outward action of their hind legs and they are
quite incapable from the socket of the thigh-bone not having a certain
ligament of jumping even the smallest vertical height they are very
stupid in making any attempt to escape when angry or frightened they
utter the tucutuco of those i kept alive several even the first day 
became quite tame not attempting to bite or to run away others were a
little wilder 

the man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found
blind a specimen which i preserved in spirits was in this state mr 
reid considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating
membrane when the animal was alive i placed my finger within half an
inch of its head and not the slightest notice was taken it made its
way however about the room nearly as well as the others considering
the strictly subterranean habits of the tucutuco the blindness though
so common cannot be a very serious evil yet it appears strange that
any animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be injured 
lamarck would have been delighted with this fact had he known it when
speculating probably with more truth than usual with him on the
gradually acquired blindness of the asphalax a gnawer living under
ground and of the proteus a reptile living in dark caverns filled
with water in both of which animals the eye is in an almost
rudimentary state and is covered by a tendinous membrane and skin in
the common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect though
many anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic
nerve its vision must certainly be imperfect though probably useful
to the animal when it leaves its burrow in the tucutuco which i
believe never comes to the surface of the ground the eye is rather
larger but often rendered blind and useless though without apparently
causing any inconvenience to the animal no doubt lamarck would have
said that the tucutuco is now passing into the state of the asphalax
and proteus 

birds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating grassy
plains around maldonado there are several species of a family allied
in structure and manners to our starling one of these molothrus
niger is remarkable from its habits several may often be seen
standing together on the back of a cow or horse and while perched on a
hedge pluming themselves in the sun they sometimes attempt to sing 
or rather to hiss the noise being very peculiar resembling that of
bubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water so as
to produce an acute sound according to azara this bird like the
cuckoo deposits its eggs in other birds nests i was several times
told by the country people that there certainly is some bird having
this habit and my assistant in collecting who is a very accurate
person found a nest of the sparrow of this country zonotrichia
matutina with one egg in it larger than the others and of a
different colour and shape in north america there is another species
of molothrus m pecoris which has a similar cuckoo-like habit and
which is most closely allied in every respect to the species from the
plata even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of
cattle it differs only in being a little smaller and in its plumage
and eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour this close
agreement in structure and habits in representative species coming
from opposite quarters of a great continent always strikes one as
interesting though of common occurrence 

mr swainson has well remarked that with the exception of the
molothrus pecoris to which must be added the m niger the cuckoos are
the only birds which can be called truly parasitical namely such as
 fasten themselves as it were on another living animal whose animal
heat brings their young into life whose food they live upon and whose
death would cause theirs during the period of infancy it is
remarkable that some of the species but not all both of the cuckoo
and molothrus should agree in this one strange habit of their
parasitical propagation whilst opposed to each other in almost every
other habit the molothrus like our starling is eminently sociable 
and lives on the open plains without art or disguise the cuckoo as
every one knows is a singularly shy bird it frequents the most
retired thickets and feeds on fruit and caterpillars in structure
also these two genera are widely removed from each other many
theories even phrenological theories have been advanced to explain
the origin of the cuckoo laying its eggs in other birds nests m 
prevost alone i think has thrown light by his observations on
this puzzle he finds that the female cuckoo which according to most
observers lays at least from four to six eggs must pair with the male
each time after laying only one or two eggs now if the cuckoo was
obliged to sit on her own eggs she would either have to sit on all
together and therefore leave those first laid so long that they
probably would become addled or she would have to hatch separately
each egg or two eggs as soon as laid but as the cuckoo stays a
shorter time in this country than any other migratory bird she
certainly would not have time enough for the successive hatchings 
hence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo pairing several times 
and laying her eggs at intervals the cause of her depositing her eggs
in other birds nests and leaving them to the care of foster-parents 
i am strongly inclined to believe that this view is correct from
having been independently led as we shall hereafter see to an
analogous conclusion with regard to the south american ostrich the
females of which are parasitical if i may so express it on each
other each female laying several eggs in the nests of several other
females and the male ostrich undertaking all the cares of incubation 
like the strange foster-parents with the cuckoo 

i will mention only two other birds which are very common and render
themselves prominent from their habits the saurophagus sulphuratus is
typical of the great american tribe of tyrant-flycatchers in its
structure it closely approaches the true shrikes but in its habits may
be compared to many birds i have frequently observed it hunting a
field hovering over one spot like a hawk and then proceeding on to
another when seen thus suspended in the air it might very readily at
a short distance be mistaken for one of the rapacious order its stoop 
however is very inferior in force and rapidity to that of a hawk at
other times the saurophagus haunts the neighbourhood of water and
there like a kingfisher remaining stationary it catches any small
fish which may come near the margin these birds are not unfrequently
kept either in cages or in courtyards with their wings cut they soon
become tame and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners which
were described to me as being similar to those of the common magpie 
their flight is undulatory for the weight of the head and bill appears
too great for the body in the evening the saurophagus takes its stand
on a bush often by the roadside and continually repeats without a
change a shrill and rather agreeable cry which somewhat resembles
articulate words the spaniards say it is like the words bien te veo 
 i see you well and accordingly have given it this name 

a mocking-bird mimus orpheus called by the inhabitants calandria is
remarkable from possessing a song far superior to that of any other
bird in the country indeed it is nearly the only bird in south
america which i have observed to take its stand for the purpose of
singing the song may be compared to that of the sedge warbler but is
more powerful some harsh notes and some very high ones being mingled
with a pleasant warbling it is heard only during the spring at
other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious near maldonado
these birds were tame and bold they constantly attended the country
houses in numbers to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or
walls if any other small bird joined the feast the calandria soon
chased it away on the wide uninhabited plains of patagonia another
closely allied species o patagonica of d orbigny which frequents the
valleys clothed with spiny bushes is a wilder bird and has a slightly
different tone of voice it appears to me a curious circumstance as
showing the fine shades of difference in habits that judging from this
latter respect alone when i first saw this second species i thought
it was different from the maldonado kind having afterwards procured a
specimen and comparing the two without particular care they appeared
so very similar that i changed my opinion but now mr gould says that
they are certainly distinct a conclusion in conformity with the
trifling difference of habit of which of course he was not aware 

the number tameness and disgusting habits of the carrion-feeding
hawks of south america make them pre-eminently striking to any one
accustomed only to the birds of northern europe in this list may be
included four species of the caracara or polyborus the turkey buzzard 
the gallinazo and the condor the caracaras are from their
structure placed among the eagles we shall soon see how ill they
become so high a rank in their habits they well supply the place of
our carrion-crows magpies and ravens a tribe of birds widely
distributed over the rest of the world but entirely absent in south
america to begin with the polyborus brasiliensis this is a common
bird and has a wide geographical range it is most numerous on the
grassy savannahs of la plata where it goes by the name of carrancha 
and is far from unfrequent throughout the sterile plains of patagonia 
in the desert between the rivers negro and colorado numbers constantly
attend the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted
animals which chance to perish from fatigue and thirst although thus
common in these dry and open countries and likewise on the arid shores
of the pacific it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious
forests of west patagonia and tierra del fuego the carranchas 
together with the chimango constantly attend in numbers the estancias
and slaughtering-houses if an animal dies on the plain the gallinazo
commences the feast and then the two species of polyborus pick the
bones clean these birds although thus commonly feeding together are
far from being friends when the carrancha is quietly seated on the
branch of a tree or on the ground the chimango often continues for a
long time flying backwards and forwards up and down in a semicircle 
trying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger
relative the carrancha takes little notice except by bobbing its
head although the carranchas frequently assemble in numbers they are
not gregarious for in desert places they may be seen solitary or more
commonly by pairs 

the carranchas are said to be very crafty and to steal great numbers
of eggs they attempt also together with the chimango to pick off
the scabs from the sore backs of horses and mules the poor animal on
the one hand with its ears down and its back arched and on the
other the hovering bird eyeing at the distance of a yard the
disgusting morsel form a picture which has been described by captain
head with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy these false eagles
most rarely kill any living bird or animal and their vulture-like 
necrophagous habits are very evident to any one who has fallen asleep
on the desolate plains of patagonia for when he wakes he will see on
each surrounding hillock one of these birds patiently watching him
with an evil eye it is a feature in the landscape of these countries 
which will be recognised by every one who has wandered over them if a
party of men go out hunting with dogs and horses they will be
accompanied during the day by several of these attendants after
feeding the uncovered craw protrudes at such times and indeed
generally the carrancha is an inactive tame and cowardly bird its
flight is heavy and slow like that of an english rook it seldom
soars but i have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the
air with much ease it runs in contradistinction to hopping but not
quite so quickly as some of its congeners at times the carrancha is
noisy but is not generally so its cry is loud very harsh and
peculiar and may be likened to the sound of the spanish guttural g 
followed by a rough double r r when uttering this cry it elevates its
head higher and higher till at last with its beak wide open the
crown almost touches the lower part of the back this fact which has
been doubted is quite true i have seen them several times with their
heads backwards in a completely inverted position to these
observations i may add on the high authority of azara that the
carrancha feeds on worms shells slugs grasshoppers and frogs that
it destroys young lambs by tearing the umbilical cord and that it
pursues the gallinazo till that bird is compelled to vomit up the
carrion it may have recently gorged lastly azara states that several
carranchas five or six together will unite in chase of large birds 
even such as herons all these facts show that it is a bird of very
versatile habits and considerable ingenuity 

the polyborus chimango is considerably smaller than the last species 
it is truly omnivorous and will eat even bread and i was assured that
it materially injures the potato crops in chiloe by stocking up the
roots when first planted of all the carrion-feeders it is generally
the last which leaves the skeleton of a dead animal and may often be
seen within the ribs of a cow or horse like a bird in a cage another
species is the polyborus novae zelandiae which is exceedingly common
in the falkland islands these birds in many respects resemble in
their habits the carranchas they live on the flesh of dead animals
and on marine productions and on the ramirez rocks their whole
sustenance must depend on the sea they are extraordinarily tame and
fearless and haunt the neighborhood of houses for offal if a hunting
party kills an animal a number soon collect and patiently await 
standing on the ground on all sides after eating their uncovered
craws are largely protruded giving them a disgusting appearance they
readily attack wounded birds a cormorant in this state having taken to
the shore was immediately seized on by several and its death hastened
by their blows the beagle was at the falklands only during the
summer but the officers of the adventure who were there in the
winter mention many extraordinary instances of the boldness and
rapacity of these birds they actually pounced on a dog that was lying
fast asleep close by one of the party and the sportsmen had difficulty
in preventing the wounded geese from being seized before their eyes it
is said that several together in this respect resembling the
carranchas wait at the mouth of a rabbit-hole and together seize on
the animal when it comes out they were constantly flying on board the
vessel when in the harbour and it was necessary to keep a good look
out to prevent the leather being torn from the rigging and the meat or
game from the stern these birds are very mischievous and inquisitive 
they will pick up almost anything from the ground a large black glazed
hat was carried nearly a mile as was a pair of the heavy balls used in
catching cattle mr usborne experienced during the survey a more
severe loss in their stealing a small kater s compass in a red morocco
leather case which was never recovered these birds are moreover 
quarrelsome and very passionate tearing up the grass with their bills
from rage they are not truly gregarious they do not soar and their
flight is heavy and clumsy on the ground they run extremely fast very
much like pheasants they are noisy uttering several harsh cries one
of which is like that of the english rook hence the sealers always
call them rooks it is a curious circumstance that when crying out 
they throw their heads upwards and backwards after the same manner as
the carrancha they build in the rocky cliffs of the sea-coast but
only on the small adjoining islets and not on the two main islands 
this is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird the
sealers say that the flesh of these birds when cooked is quite white 
and very good eating but bold must the man be who attempts such a meal 

we have now only to mention the turkey-buzzard vultur aura and the
gallinazo the former is found wherever the country is moderately
damp from cape horn to north america differently from the polyborus
brasiliensis and chimango it has found its way to the falkland
islands the turkey-buzzard is a solitary bird or at most goes in
pairs it may at once be recognised from a long distance by its
lofty soaring and most elegant flight it is well known to be a true
carrion-feeder on the west coast of patagonia among the
thickly-wooded islets and broken land it lives exclusively on what the
sea throws up and on the carcasses of dead seals wherever these
animals are congregated on the rocks there the vultures may be seen 
the gallinazo cathartes atratus has a different range from the last
species as it never occurs southward of lat degs azara states
that there exists a tradition that these birds at the time of the
conquest were not found near monte video but that they subsequently
followed the inhabitants from more northern districts at the present
day they are numerous in the valley of the colorado which is three
hundred miles due south of monte video it seems probable that this
additional migration has happened since the time of azara the
gallinazo generally prefers a humid climate or rather the
neighbourhood of fresh water hence it is extremely abundant in brazil
and la plata while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of
northern patagonia excepting near some stream these birds frequent
the whole pampas to the foot of the cordillera but i never saw or
heard of one in chile in peru they are preserved as scavengers these
vultures certainly may be called gregarious for they seem to have
pleasure in society and are not solely brought together by the
attraction of a common prey on a fine day a flock may often be
observed at a great height each bird wheeling round and round without
closing its wings in the most graceful evolutions this is clearly
performed for the mere pleasure of the exercise or perhaps is
connected with their matrimonial alliances 

i have now mentioned all the carrion-feeders excepting the condor an
account of which will be more appropriately introduced when we visit a
country more congenial to its habits than the plains of la plata 


in a broad band of sand-hillocks which separate the laguna del potrero
from the shores of the plata at the distance of a few miles from
maldonado i found a group of those vitrified siliceous tubes which
are formed by lightning entering loose sand these tubes resemble in
every particular those from drigg in cumberland described in the
geological transactions the sand-hillocks of maldonado not being
protected by vegetation are constantly changing their position from
this cause the tubes projected above the surface and numerous
fragments lying near showed that they had formerly been buried to a
greater depth four sets entered the sand perpendicularly by working
with my hands i traced one of them two feet deep and some fragments
which evidently had belonged to the same tube when added to the other
part measured five feet three inches the diameter of the whole tube
was nearly equal and therefore we must suppose that originally it
extended to a much greater depth these dimensions are however small 
compared to those of the tubes from drigg one of which was traced to a
depth of not less than thirty feet 

the internal surface is completely vitrified glossy and smooth a
small fragment examined under the microscope appeared from the number
of minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles like an assay fused
before the blowpipe the sand is entirely or in greater part 
siliceous but some points are of a black colour and from their glossy
surface possess a metallic lustre the thickness of the wall of the
tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch and
occasionally even equals a tenth on the outside the grains of sand
are rounded and have a slightly glazed appearance i could not
distinguish any signs of crystallization in a similar manner to that
described in the geological transactions the tubes are generally
compressed and have deep longitudinal furrows so as closely to
resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk or the bark of the elm or cork
tree their circumference is about two inches but in some fragments 
which are cylindrical and without any furrows it is as much as four
inches the compression from the surrounding loose sand acting while
the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat has
evidently caused the creases or furrows judging from the uncompressed
fragments the measure or bore of the lightning if such a term may be
used must have been about one inch and a quarter at paris m 
hachette and m beudant succeeded in making tubes in most
respects similar to these fulgurites by passing very strong shocks of
galvanism through finely-powdered glass when salt was added so as to
increase its fusibility the tubes were larger in every dimension they
failed both with powdered felspar and quartz one tube formed with
pounded glass was very nearly an inch long namely and had an
internal diameter of of an inch when we hear that the strongest
battery in paris was used and that its power on a substance of such
easy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so diminutive we must feel
greatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning which 
striking the sand in several places has formed cylinders in one
instance of at least thirty feet long and having an internal bore 
where not compressed of full an inch and a half and this in a
material so extraordinarily refractory as quartz 

the tubes as i have already remarked enter the sand nearly in a
vertical direction one however which was less regular than the
others deviated from a right line at the most considerable bend to
the amount of thirty-three degrees from this same tube two small
branches about a foot apart were sent off one pointed downwards and
the other upwards this latter case is remarkable as the electric
fluid must have turned back at the acute angle of degs to the line
of its main course besides the four tubes which i found vertical and
traced beneath the surface there were several other groups of
fragments the original sites of which without doubt were near all
occurred in a level area of shifting sand sixty yards by twenty 
situated among some high sand-hillocks and at the distance of about
half a mile from a chain of hills four or five hundred feet in height 
the most remarkable circumstance as it appears to me in this case as
well as in that of drigg and in one described by m ribbentrop in
germany is the number of tubes found within such limited spaces at
drigg within an area of fifteen yards three were observed and the
same number occurred in germany in the case which i have described 
certainly more than four existed within the space of the sixty by
twenty yards as it does not appear probable that the tubes are
produced by successive distinct shocks we must believe that the
lightning shortly before entering the ground divides itself into
separate branches 

the neighbourhood of the rio plata seems peculiarly subject to electric
phenomena in the year one of the most destructive
thunderstorms perhaps on record happened at buenos ayres thirty-seven
places within the city were struck by lightning and nineteen people
killed from facts stated in several books of travels i am inclined
to suspect that thunderstorms are very common near the mouths of great
rivers is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh
and salt water may disturb the electrical equilibrium even during our
occasional visits to this part of south america we heard of a ship 
two churches and a house having been struck both the church and the
house i saw shortly afterwards the house belonged to mr hood the
consul-general at monte video some of the effects were curious the
paper for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the bell-wires
had run was blackened the metal had been fused and although the
room was about fifteen feet high the globules dropping on the chairs
and furniture had drilled in them a chain of minute holes a part of
the wall was shattered as if by gunpowder and the fragments had been
blown off with force sufficient to dent the wall on the opposite side
of the room the frame of a looking-glass was blackened and the
gilding must have been volatilized for a smelling-bottle which stood
on the chimney-piece was coated with bright metallic particles which
adhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled

 in south america i collected altogether twenty-seven species of
mice and thirteen more are known from the works of azara and other
authors those collected by myself have been named and described by
mr waterhouse at the meetings of the zoological society i must be
allowed to take this opportunity of returning my cordial thanks to mr 
waterhouse and to the other gentleman attached to that society for
their kind and most liberal assistance on all occasions 

 in the stomach and duodenum of a capybara which i opened i found a
very large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid in which scarcely a
fibre could be distinguished mr owen informs me that a part of the
oesophagus is so constructed that nothing much larger than a crowquill
can be passed down certainly the broad teeth and strong jaws of this
animal are well fitted to grind into pulp the aquatic plants on which
it feeds 

 at the r negro in northern patagonia there is an animal of the
same habits and probably a closely allied species but which i never
saw its noise is different from that of the maldonado kind it is
repeated only twice instead of three or four times and is more
distinct and sonorous when heard from a distance it so closely
resembles the sound made in cutting down a small tree with an axe that
i have sometimes remained in doubt concerning it

july th the beagle sailed from maldonado and on august the
rd she arrived off the mouth of the rio negro this is the principal
river on the whole line of coast between the strait of magellan and the
plata it enters the sea about three hundred miles south of the
estuary of the plata about fifty years ago under the old spanish
government a small colony was established here and it is still the
most southern position lat degs on this eastern coast of america
inhabited by civilized man 

the country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme on
the south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences which
exposes a section of the geological nature of the country the strata
are of sandstone and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a
firmly-cemented conglomerate of pumice pebbles which must have
travelled more than four hundred miles from the andes the surface is
everywhere covered up by a thick bed of gravel which extends far and
wide over the open plain water is extremely scarce and where found 
is almost invariably brackish the vegetation is scanty and although
there are bushes of many kinds all are armed with formidable thorns 
which seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable
regions 

the settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river the road
follows the foot of the sloping cliff which forms the northern
boundary of the great valley in which the rio negro flows on the way
we passed the ruins of some fine estancias which a few years since
had been destroyed by the indians they withstood several attacks a
man present at one gave me a very lively description of what took
place the inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle
and horses into the corral which surrounded the house and
likewise to mount some small cannon the indians were araucanians from
the south of chile several hundreds in number and highly disciplined 
they first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill having there
dismounted and taken off their fur mantles they advanced naked to the
charge the only weapon of an indian is a very long bamboo or chuzo 
ornamented with ostrich feathers and pointed by a sharp spearhead my
informer seemed to remember with the greatest horror the quivering of
these chuzos as they approached near when close the cacique
pincheira hailed the besieged to give up their arms or he would cut
all their throats as this would probably have been the result of
their entrance under any circumstances the answer was given by a
volley of musketry the indians with great steadiness came to the
very fence of the corral but to their surprise they found the posts
fastened together by iron nails instead of leather thongs and of
course in vain attempted to cut them with their knives this saved
the lives of the christians many of the wounded indians were carried
away by their companions and at last one of the under caciques being
wounded the bugle sounded a retreat they retired to their horses 
and seemed to hold a council of war this was an awful pause for the
spaniards as all their ammunition with the exception of a few
cartridges was expended in an instant the indians mounted their
horses and galloped out of sight another attack was still more
quickly repulsed a cool frenchman managed the gun he stopped till the
indians approached close and then raked their line with grape-shot he
thus laid thirty-nine of them on the ground and of course such a
blow immediately routed the whole party 

the town is indifferently called el carmen or patagones it is built on
the face of a cliff which fronts the river and many of the houses are
excavated even in the sandstone the river is about two or three
hundred yards wide and is deep and rapid the many islands with
their willow-trees and the flat headlands seen one behind the other
on the northern boundary of the broad green valley form by the aid of
a bright sun a view almost picturesque the number of inhabitants
does not exceed a few hundreds these spanish colonies do not like
our british ones carry within themselves the elements of growth many
indians of pure blood reside here the tribe of the cacique lucanee
constantly have their toldos on the outskirts of the town the
local government partly supplies them with provisions by giving them
all the old worn-out horses and they earn a little by making
horse-rugs and other articles of riding-gear these indians are
considered civilized but what their character may have gained by a
lesser degree of ferocity is almost counterbalanced by their entire
immorality some of the younger men are however improving they are
willing to labour and a short time since a party went on a
sealing-voyage and behaved very well they were now enjoying the
fruits of their labour by being dressed in very gay clean clothes 
and by being very idle the taste they showed in their dress was
admirable if you could have turned one of these young indians into a
statue of bronze his drapery would have been perfectly graceful 

one day i rode to a large salt-lake or salina which is distant
fifteen miles from the town during the winter it consists of a
shallow lake of brine which in summer is converted into a field of
snow-white salt the layer near the margin is from four to five inches
thick but towards the centre its thickness increases this lake was
two and a half miles long and one broad others occur in the
neighbourhood many times larger and with a floor of salt two and
three feet in thickness even when under water during the winter one
of these brilliantly white and level expanses in the midst of the brown
and desolate plain offers an extraordinary spectacle a large
quantity of salt is annually drawn from the salina and great piles 
some hundred tons in weight were lying ready for exportation the
season for working the salinas forms the harvest of patagones for on
it the prosperity of the place depends nearly the whole population
encamps on the bank of the river and the people are employed in
drawing out the salt in bullock-waggons this salt is crystallized in
great cubes and is remarkably pure mr trenham reeks has kindly
analyzed some for me and he finds in it only of gypsum and 
of earthy matter it is a singular fact that it does not serve so
well for preserving meat as sea-salt from the cape de verd islands and
a merchant at buenos ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per
cent less valuable hence the cape de verd salt is constantly
imported and is mixed with that from these salinas the purity of the
patagonian salt or absence from it of those other saline bodies found
in all sea-water is the only assignable cause for this inferiority a
conclusion which no one i think would have suspected but which is
supported by the fact lately ascertained that those salts answer
best for preserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent
chlorides 

the border of this lake is formed of mud and in this numerous large
crystals of gypsum some of which are three inches long lie embedded 
whilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about 
the gauchos call the former the padre del sal and the latter the
 madre they state that these progenitive salts always occur on the
borders of the salinas when the water begins to evaporate the mud is
black and has a fetid odour i could not at first imagine the cause
of this but i afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind
drifted on shore was coloured green as if by confervae i attempted to
carry home some of this green matter but from an accident failed 
parts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish
colour and this perhaps was owing to some infusorial animalcula the
mud in many places was thrown up by numbers of some kind of worm or
annelidous animal how surprising it is that any creatures should be
able to exist in brine and that they should be crawling among crystals
of sulphate of soda and lime and what becomes of these worms when 
during the long summer the surface is hardened into a solid layer of
salt flamingoes in considerable numbers inhabit this lake and breed
here throughout patagonia in northern chile and at the galapagos
islands i met with these birds wherever there were lakes of brine i
saw them here wading about in search of food probably for the worms
which burrow in the mud and these latter probably feed on infusoria or
confervae thus we have a little living world within itself adapted to
these inland lakes of brine a minute crustaceous animal cancer
salinus is said to live in countless numbers in the brine-pans at
lymington but only in those in which the fluid has attained from
evaporation considerable strength namely about a quarter of a pound
of salt to a pint of water well may we affirm that every part of the
world is habitable whether lakes of brine or those subterranean ones
hidden beneath volcanic mountains warm mineral springs the wide
expanse and depths of the ocean the upper regions of the atmosphere 
and even the surface of perpetual snow all support organic beings 


to the northward of the rio negro between it and the inhabited country
near buenos ayres the spaniards have only one small settlement 
recently established at bahia blanca the distance in a straight line
to buenos ayres is very nearly five hundred british miles the
wandering tribes of horse indians which have always occupied the
greater part of this country having of late much harassed the outlying
estancias the government at buenos ayres equipped some time since an
army under the command of general rosas for the purpose of
exterminating them the troops were now encamped on the banks of the
colorado a river lying about eighty miles northward of the rio negro 
when general rosas left buenos ayres he struck in a direct line across
the unexplored plains and as the country was thus pretty well cleared
of indians he left behind him at wide intervals a small party of
soldiers with a troop of horses a posta so as to be enabled to keep
up a communication with the capital as the beagle intended to call at
bahia blanca i determined to proceed there by land and ultimately i
extended my plan to travel the whole way by the postas to buenos ayres 

august th mr harris an englishman residing at patagones a guide 
and five gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business were my
companions on the journey the colorado as i have already said is
nearly eighty miles distant and as we travelled slowly we were two
days and a half on the road the whole line of country deserves
scarcely a better name than that of a desert water is found only in
two small wells it is called fresh but even at this time of the year 
during the rainy season it was quite brackish in the summer this must
be a distressing passage for now it was sufficiently desolate the
valley of the rio negro broad as it is has merely been excavated out
of the sandstone plain for immediately above the bank on which the
town stands a level country commences which is interrupted only by a
few trifling valleys and depressions everywhere the landscape wears
the same sterile aspect a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of brown
withered grass and low scattered bushes armed with thorns 

shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous
tree which the indians reverence as the altar of walleechu it is
situated on a high part of the plain and hence is a landmark visible
at a great distance as soon as a tribe of indians come in sight of
it they offer their adorations by loud shouts the tree itself is
low much branched and thorny just above the root it has a diameter
of about three feet it stands by itself without any neighbour and
was indeed the first tree we saw afterwards we met with a few others
of the same kind but they were far from common being winter the tree
had no leaves but in their place numberless threads by which the
various offerings such as cigars bread meat pieces of cloth etc 
had been suspended poor indians not having anything better only pull
a thread out of their ponchos and fasten it to the tree richer
indians are accustomed to pour spirits and mate into a certain hole 
and likewise to smoke upwards thinking thus to afford all possible
gratification to walleechu to complete the scene the tree was
surrounded by the bleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered
as sacrifices all indians of every age and sex make their offerings 
they then think that their horses will not tire and that they
themselves shall be prosperous the gaucho who told me this said that
in the time of peace he had witnessed this scene and that he and
others used to wait till the indians had passed by for the sake of
stealing from walleechu the offerings 

the gauchos think that the indians consider the tree as the god itself 
but it seems for more probable that they regard it as the altar the
only cause which i can imagine for this choice is its being a landmark
in a dangerous passage the sierra de la ventana is visible at an
immense distance and a gaucho told me that he was once riding with an
indian a few miles to the north of the rio colorado when the indian
commenced making the same loud noise which is usual at the first sight
of the distant tree putting his hand to his head and then pointing in
the direction of the sierra upon being asked the reason of this the
indian said in broken spanish first see the sierra about two
leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night at this
instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the lynx-eyed gauchos who set
off in full chase and in a few minutes dragged her in with their
lazos and slaughtered her we here had the four necessaries of life
 en el campo pasture for the horses water only a muddy puddle 
meat and firewood the gauchos were in high spirits at finding all
these luxuries and we soon set to work at the poor cow this was the
first night which i passed under the open sky with the gear of the
recado for my bed there is high enjoyment in the independence of the
gaucho life to be able at any moment to pull up your horse and say 
 here we will pass the night the death-like stillness of the plain 
the dogs keeping watch the gipsy-group of gauchos making their beds
round the fire have left in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this
first night which will never be forgotten 

the next day the country continued similar to that above described it
is inhabited by few birds or animals of any kind occasionally a deer 
or a guanaco wild llama may be seen but the agouti cavia
patagonica is the commonest quadruped this animal here represents
our hares it differs however from that genus in many essential
respects for instance it has only three toes behind it is also
nearly twice the size weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds the
agouti is a true friend of the desert it is a common feature of the
landscape to see two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a
straight line across these wild plains they are found as far north as
the sierra tapalguen lat degs where the plain rather
suddenly becomes greener and more humid and their southern limit is
between port desire and st julian where there is no change in the
nature of the country it is a singular fact that although the agouti
is not now found as far south as port st julian yet that captain
wood in his voyage in talks of them as being numerous there 
what cause can have altered in a wide uninhabited and rarely-visited
country the range of an animal like this it appears also from the
number shot by captain wood in one day at port desire that they must
have been considerably more abundant there formerly than at present 
where the bizcacha lives and makes its burrows the agouti uses them 
but where as at bahia blanca the bizcacha is not found the agouti
burrows for itself the same thing occurs with the little owl of the
pampas athene cunicularia which has so often been described as
standing like a sentinel at the mouth of the burrows for in banda
oriental owing to the absence of the bizcacha it is obliged to hollow
out its own habitation 

the next morning as we approached the rio colorado the appearance of
the country changed we soon came on a plain covered with turf which 
from its flowers tall clover and little owls resembled the pampas 
we passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent which in summer
dries and becomes incrusted with various salts and hence is called a
salitral it was covered by low succulent plants of the same kind
with those growing on the sea-shore the colorado at the pass where
we crossed it is only about sixty yards wide generally it must be
nearly double that width its course is very tortuous being marked by
willow-trees and beds of reeds in a direct line the distance to the
mouth of the river is said to be nine leagues but by water
twenty-five we were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense
troops of mares which were swimming the river in order to follow a
division of troops into the interior a more ludicrous spectacle i
never beheld than the hundreds and hundreds of heads all directed one
way with pointed ears and distended snorting nostrils appearing just
above the water like a great shoal of some amphibious animal mare s
flesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition 
this gives them a great facility of movement for the distance to which
horses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising i have been
assured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for
many days successively 

the encampment of general rosas was close to the river it consisted of
a square formed by waggons artillery straw huts etc the soldiers
were nearly all cavalry and i should think such a villainous 
banditti-like army was never before collected together the greater
number of men were of a mixed breed between negro indian and
spaniard i know not the reason but men of such origin seldom have a
good expression of countenance i called on the secretary to show my
passport he began to cross-question me in the most dignified and
mysterious manner by good luck i had a letter of recommendation from
the government of buenos ayres to the commandant of patagones this
was taken to general rosas who sent me a very obliging message and
the secretary returned all smiles and graciousness we took up our
residence in the rancho or hovel of a curious old spaniard who had
served with napoleon in the expedition against russia 

we stayed two days at the colorado i had little to do for the
surrounding country was a swamp which in summer december when the
snow melts on the cordillera is over-flowed by the river my chief
amusement was watching the indian families as they came to buy little
articles at the rancho where we stayed it was supposed that general
rosas had about six hundred indian allies the men were a tall fine
race yet it was afterwards easy to see in the fuegian savage the same
countenance rendered hideous by cold want of food and less
civilization some authors in defining the primary races of mankind 
have separated these indians into two classes but this is certainly
incorrect among the young women or chinas some deserve to be called
even beautiful their hair was coarse but bright and black and they
wore it in two plaits hanging down to the waist they had a high
colour and eyes that glistened with brilliancy their legs feet and
arms were small and elegantly formed their ankles and sometimes their
wrists were ornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads nothing
could be more interesting than some of the family groups a mother
with one or two daughters would often come to our rancho mounted on
the same horse they ride like men but with their knees tucked up
much higher this habit perhaps arises from their being accustomed 
when travelling to ride the loaded horses the duty of the women is
to load and unload the horses to make the tents for the night in
short to be like the wives of all savages useful slaves the men
fight hunt take care of the horses and make the riding gear one of
their chief indoor occupations is to knock two stones together till
they become round in order to make the bolas with this important
weapon the indian catches his game and also his horse which roams
free over the plain in fighting his first attempt is to throw down
the horse of his adversary with the bolas and when entangled by the
fall to kill him with the chuzo if the balls only catch the neck or
body of an animal they are often carried away and lost as the making
the stones round is the labour of two days the manufacture of the
balls is a very common employment several of the men and women had
their faces painted red but i never saw the horizontal bands which are
so common among the fuegians their chief pride consists in having
everything made of silver i have seen a cacique with his spurs 
stirrups handle of his knife and bridle made of this metal the
head-stall and reins being of wire were not thicker than whipcord and
to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a
chain gave to the horsemanship a remarkable character of elegance 

general rosas intimated a wish to see me a circumstance which i was
afterwards very glad of he is a man of an extraordinary character 
and has a most predominant influence in the country which it seems he
will use to its prosperity and advancement he is said to be the
owner of seventy-four square leagues of land and to have about three
hundred thousand head of cattle his estates are admirably managed 
and are far more productive of corn than those of others he first
gained his celebrity by his laws for his own estancias and by
disciplining several hundred men so as to resist with success the
attacks of the indians there are many stories current about the rigid
manner in which his laws were enforced one of these was that no man 
on penalty of being put into the stocks should carry his knife on a
sunday this being the principal day for gambling and drinking many
quarrels arose which from the general manner of fighting with the
knife often proved fatal one sunday the governor came in great form
to pay the estancia a visit and general rosas in his hurry walked
out to receive him with his knife as usual stuck in his belt the
steward touched his arm and reminded him of the law upon which
turning to the governor he said he was extremely sorry but that he
must go into the stocks and that till let out he possessed no power
even in his own house after a little time the steward was persuaded
to open the stocks and to let him out but no sooner was this done 
than he turned to the steward and said you now have broken the laws 
so you must take my place in the stocks such actions as these
delighted the gauchos who all possess high notions of their own
equality and dignity 

general rosas is also a perfect horseman an accomplishment of no small
consequence in a country where an assembled army elected its general by
the following trial a troop of unbroken horses being driven into a
corral were let out through a gateway above which was a cross-bar it
was agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild
animals as it rushed out and should be able without saddle or
bridle not only to ride it but also to bring it back to the door of
the corral should be their general the person who succeeded was
accordingly elected and doubtless made a fit general for such an army 
this extraordinary feat has also been performed by rosas 

by these means and by conforming to the dress and habits of the
gauchos he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country and in
consequence a despotic power i was assured by an english merchant 
that a man who had murdered another when arrested and questioned
concerning his motive answered he spoke disrespectfully of general
rosas so i killed him at the end of a week the murderer was at
liberty this doubtless was the act of the general s party and not of
the general himself 

in conversation he is enthusiastic sensible and very grave his
gravity is carried to a high pitch i heard one of his mad buffoons
 for he keeps two like the barons of old relate the following
anecdote i wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music so i
went to the general two or three times to ask him he said to me go
about your business for i am engaged i went a second time he said 
 if you come again i will punish you a third time i asked and he
laughed i rushed out of the tent but it was too late he ordered two
soldiers to catch and stake me i begged by all the saints in heaven
he would let me off but it would not do when the general laughs he
spares neither mad man nor sound the poor flighty gentleman looked
quite dolorous at the very recollection of the staking this is a
very severe punishment four posts are driven into the ground and the
man is extended by his arms and legs horizontally and there left to
stretch for several hours the idea is evidently taken from the usual
method of drying hides my interview passed away without a smile and
i obtained a passport and order for the government post-horses and
this he gave me in the most obliging and ready manner 

in the morning we started for bahia blanca which we reached in two
days leaving the regular encampment we passed by the toldos of the
indians these are round like ovens and covered with hides by the
mouth of each a tapering chuzo was stuck in the ground the toldos
were divided into separate groups which belong to the different
caciques tribes and the groups were again divided into smaller ones 
according to the relationship of the owners for several miles we
travelled along the valley of the colorado the alluvial plains on the
side appeared fertile and it is supposed that they are well adapted to
the growth of corn turning northward from the river we soon entered
on a country differing from the plains south of the river the land
still continued dry and sterile but it supported many different kinds
of plants and the grass though brown and withered was more abundant 
as the thorny bushes were less so these latter in a short space
entirely disappeared and the plains were left without a thicket to
cover their nakedness this change in the vegetation marks the
commencement of the grand calcareo argillaceous deposit which forms
the wide extent of the pampas and covers the granitic rocks of banda
oriental from the strait of magellan to the colorado a distance of
about eight hundred miles the face of the country is everywhere
composed of shingle the pebbles are chiefly of porphyry and probably
owe their origin to the rocks of the cordillera north of the colorado
this bed thins out and the pebbles become exceedingly small and here
the characteristic vegetation of patagonia ceases 

having ridden about twenty-five miles we came to a broad belt of
sand-dunes which stretches as far as the eye can reach to the east
and west the sand-hillocks resting on the clay allow small pools of
water to collect and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable
supply of fresh water the great advantage arising from depressions
and elevations of the soil is not often brought home to the mind the
two miserable springs in the long passage between the rio negro and
colorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain without
them not a drop of water would have been found the belt of sand-dunes
is about eight miles wide at some former period it probably formed
the margin of a grand estuary where the colorado now flows in this
district where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land
occur such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one although
merely considering the physical geography of the country having
crossed the sandy tract we arrived in the evening at one of the
post-houses and as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we
determined to pass the night there 

the house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two
hundred feet high a most remarkable feature in this country this
posta was commanded by a negro lieutenant born in africa to his
credit be it said there was not a ranche between the colorado and
buenos ayres in nearly such neat order as his he had a little room
for strangers and a small corral for the horses all made of sticks
and reeds he had also dug a ditch round his house as a defence in case
of being attacked this would however have been of little avail if
the indians had come but his chief comfort seemed to rest in the
thought of selling his life dearly a short time before a body of
indians had travelled past in the night if they had been aware of the
posta our black friend and his four soldiers would assuredly have been
slaughtered i did not anywhere meet a more civil and obliging man
than this negro it was therefore the more painful to see that he would
not sit down and eat with us 

in the morning we sent for the horses very early and started for
another exhilarating gallop we passed the cabeza del buey an old
name given to the head of a large marsh which extends from bahia
blanca here we changed horses and passed through some leagues of
swamps and saline marshes changing horses for the last time we again
began wading through the mud my animal fell and i was well soused in
black mire a very disagreeable accident when one does not possess a
change of clothes some miles from the fort we met a man who told us
that a great gun had been fired which is a signal that indians are
near we immediately left the road and followed the edge of a marsh 
which when chased offers the best mode of escape we were glad to
arrive within the walls when we found all the alarm was about nothing 
for the indians turned out to be friendly ones who wished to join
general rosas 

bahia blanca scarcely deserves the name of a village a few houses and
the barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified
wall the settlement is only of recent standing since and its
growth has been one of trouble the government of buenos ayres
unjustly occupied it by force instead of following the wise example of
the spanish viceroys who purchased the land near the older settlement
of the rio negro from the indians hence the need of the
fortifications hence the few houses and little cultivated land without
the limits of the walls even the cattle are not safe from the attacks
of the indians beyond the boundaries of the plain on which the
fortress stands 

the part of the harbour where the beagle intended to anchor being
distant twenty-five miles i obtained from the commandant a guide and
horses to take me to see whether she had arrived leaving the plain
of green turf which extended along the course of a little brook we
soon entered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand saline
marshes or bare mud some parts were clothed by low thickets and
others with those succulent plants which luxuriate only where salt
abounds bad as the country was ostriches deer agoutis and
armadilloes were abundant my guide told me that two months before
he had a most narrow escape of his life he was out hunting with two
other men at no great distance from this part of the country when
they were suddenly met by a party of indians who giving chase soon
overtook and killed his two friends his own horse s legs were also
caught by the bolas but he jumped off and with his knife cut them
free while doing this he was obliged to dodge round his horse and
received two severe wounds from their chuzos springing on the saddle 
he managed by a most wonderful exertion just to keep ahead of the
long spears of his pursuers who followed him to within sight of the
fort from that time there was an order that no one should stray far
from the settlement i did not know of this when i started and was
surprised to observe how earnestly my guide watched a deer which
appeared to have been frightened from a distant quarter 

we found the beagle had not arrived and consequently set out on our
return but the horses soon tiring we were obliged to bivouac on the
plain in the morning we had caught an armadillo which although a
most excellent dish when roasted in its shell did not make a very
substantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men the ground at the
place where we stopped for the night was incrusted with a layer of
sulphate of soda and hence of course was without water yet many of
the smaller rodents managed to exist even here and the tucutuco was
making its odd little grunt beneath my head during half the night our
horses were very poor ones and in the morning they were soon exhausted
from not having had anything to drink so that we were obliged to walk 
about noon the dogs killed a kid which we roasted i ate some of it 
but it made me intolerably thirsty this was the more distressing as
the road from some recent rain was full of little puddles of clear
water yet not a drop was drinkable i had scarcely been twenty hours
without water and only part of the time under a hot sun yet the
thirst rendered me very weak how people survive two or three days
under such circumstances i cannot imagine at the same time i must
confess that my guide did not suffer at all and was astonished that
one day s deprivation should be so troublesome to me 

i have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being
incrusted with salt this phenomenon is quite different from that of
the salinas and more extraordinary in many parts of south america 
wherever the climate is moderately dry these incrustations occur but
i have nowhere seen them so abundant as near bahia blanca the salt
here and in other parts of patagonia consists chiefly of sulphate of
soda with some common salt as long as the ground remains moist in the
salitrales as the spaniards improperly call them mistaking this
substance for saltpeter nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain
composed of a black muddy soil supporting scattered tufts of
succulent plants on returning through one of these tracts after a
week s hot weather one is surprised to see square miles of the plain
white as if from a slight fall of snow here and there heaped up by
the wind into little drifts this latter appearance is chiefly caused
by the salts being drawn up during the slow evaporation of the
moisture round blades of dead grass stumps of wood and pieces of
broken earth instead of being crystallized at the bottoms of the
puddles of water the salitrales occur either on level tracts elevated
only a few feet above the level of the sea or on alluvial land
bordering rivers m parchappe found that the saline incrustation
on the plain at the distance of some miles from the sea consisted
chiefly of sulphate of soda with only seven per cent of common salt 
whilst nearer to the coast the common salt increased to parts in a
hundred this circumstance would tempt one to believe that the
sulphate of soda is generated in the soil from the muriate left on
the surface during the slow and recent elevation of this dry country 
the whole phenomenon is well worthy the attention of naturalists have
the succulent salt-loving plants which are well known to contain much
soda the power of decomposing the muriate does the black fetid mud 
abounding with organic matter yield the sulphur and ultimately the
sulphuric acid 

two days afterwards i again rode to the harbour when not far from our
destination my companion the same man as before spied three people
hunting on horseback he immediately dismounted and watching them
intently said they don t ride like christians and nobody can leave
the fort the three hunters joined company and likewise dismounted
from their horses at last one mounted again and rode over the hill
out of sight my companion said we must now get on our horses load
your pistol and he looked to his own sword i asked are they
indians quien sabe who knows if there are no more than three 
it does not signify it then struck me that the one man had gone over
the hill to fetch the rest of his tribe i suggested this but all the
answer i could extort was quien sabe his head and eye never for a
minute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon i thought his
uncommon coolness too good a joke and asked him why he did not return
home i was startled when he answered we are returning but in a
line so as to pass near a swamp into which we can gallop the horses as
far as they can go and then trust to our own legs so that there is no
danger i did not feel quite so confident of this and wanted to
increase our pace he said no not until they do when any little
inequality concealed us we galloped but when in sight continued
walking at last we reached a valley and turning to the left 
galloped quickly to the foot of a hill he gave me his horse to hold 
made the dogs lie down and then crawled on his hands and knees to
reconnoitre he remained in this position for some time and at last 
bursting out in laughter exclaimed mugeres women he knew them
to be the wife and sister-in-law of the major s son hunting for
ostrich s eggs i have described this man s conduct because he acted
under the full impression that they were indians as soon however as
the absurd mistake was found out he gave me a hundred reasons why they
could not have been indians but all these were forgotten at the time 
we then rode on in peace and quietness to a low point called punta
alta whence we could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of
bahia blanca 

the wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great mud-banks 
which the inhabitants call cangrejales or crabberies from the
number of small crabs the mud is so soft that it is impossible to
walk over them even for the shortest distance many of the banks have
their surfaces covered with long rushes the tops of which alone are
visible at high water on one occasion when in a boat we were so
entangled by these shallows that we could hardly find our way nothing
was visible but the flat beds of mud the day was not very clear and
there was much refraction or as the sailors expressed it things
loomed high the only object within our view which was not level was
the horizon rushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air and
water like mud-banks and mud-banks like water 

we passed the night in punta alta and i employed myself in searching
for fossil bones this point being a perfect catacomb for monsters of
extinct races the evening was perfectly calm and clear the extreme
monotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of mud-banks
and gulls sand-hillocks and solitary vultures in riding back in the
morning we came across a very fresh track of a puma but did not
succeed in finding it we saw also a couple of zorillos or
skunks odious animals which are far from uncommon in general
appearance the zorillo resembles a polecat but it is rather larger 
and much thicker in proportion conscious of its power it roams by day
about the open plain and fears neither dog nor man if a dog is urged
to the attack its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the
fetid oil which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose 
whatever is once polluted by it is for ever useless azara says the
smell can be perceived at a league distant more than once when
entering the harbour of monte video the wind being off shore we have
perceived the odour on board the beagle certain it is that every
animal most willingly makes room for the zorillo 

 the corral is an enclosure made of tall and strong stakes every
estancia or farming estate has one attached to it 

 the hovels of the indians are thus called

elevated above the waters of the sea in both countries the salt-lakes
occupy shallow depressions in the plains in both the mud on the
borders is black and fetid beneath the crust of common salt sulphate
of soda or of magnesium occurs imperfectly crystallized and in both 
the muddy sand is mixed with lentils of gypsum the siberian
salt-lakes are inhabited by small crustaceous animals and flamingoes

the beagle arrived here on the th of august and a week afterwards
sailed for the plata with captain fitz roy s consent i was left
behind to travel by land to buenos ayres i will here add some
observations which were made during this visit and on a previous
occasion when the beagle was employed in surveying the harbour 

the plain at the distance of a few miles from the coast belongs to
the great pampean formation which consists in part of a reddish clay 
and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock nearer the coast there
are some plains formed from the wreck of the upper plain and from mud 
gravel and sand thrown up by the sea during the slow elevation of the
land of which elevation we have evidence in upraised beds of recent
shells and in rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over the country at
punta alta we have a section of one of these later-formed little
plains which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary
character of the remains of gigantic land-animals embedded in it these
have been fully described by professor owen in the zoology of the
voyage of the beagle and are deposited in the college of surgeons i
will here give only a brief outline of their nature 

first parts of three heads and other bones of the megatherium the
huge dimensions of which are expressed by its name secondly the
megalonyx a great allied animal thirdly the scelidotherium also an
allied animal of which i obtained a nearly perfect skeleton it must
have been as large as a rhinoceros in the structure of its head it
comes according to mr owen nearest to the cape anteater but in some
other respects it approaches to the armadilloes fourthly the mylodon
darwinii a closely related genus of little inferior size fifthly 
another gigantic edental quadruped sixthly a large animal with an
osseous coat in compartments very like that of an armadillo 
seventhly an extinct kind of horse to which i shall have again to
refer eighthly a tooth of a pachydermatous animal probably the same
with the macrauchenia a huge beast with a long neck like a camel 
which i shall also refer to again lastly the toxodon perhaps one of
the strangest animals ever discovered in size it equalled an elephant
or megatherium but the structure of its teeth as mr owen states 
proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the gnawers the
order which at the present day includes most of the smallest
quadrupeds in many details it is allied to the pachydermata judging
from the position of its eyes ears and nostrils it was probably
aquatic like the dugong and manatee to which it is also allied how
wonderfully are the different orders at the present time so well
separated blended together in different points of the structure of the
toxodon 

the remains of these nine great quadrupeds and many detached bones 
were found embedded on the beach within the space of about yards
square it is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species
should be found together and it proves how numerous in kind the
ancient inhabitants of this country must have been at the distance of
about thirty miles from punta alta in a cliff of red earth i found
several fragments of bones some of large size among them were the
teeth of a gnawer equalling in size and closely resembling those of
the capybara whose habits have been described and therefore 
probably an aquatic animal there was also part of the head of a
ctenomys the species being different from the tucutuco but with a
close general resemblance the red earth like that of the pampas in
which these remains were embedded contains according to professor
ehrenberg eight fresh-water and one salt-water infusorial animalcule 
therefore probably it was an estuary deposit 

the remains at punta alta were embedded in stratified gravel and
reddish mud just such as the sea might now wash up on a shallow bank 
they were associated with twenty-three species of shells of which
thirteen are recent and four others very closely related to recent
forms from the bones of the scelidotherium including even the
knee-cap being intombed in their proper relative positions and from
the osseous armour of the great armadillo-like animal being so well
preserved together with the bones of one of its legs we may feel
assured that these remains were fresh and united by their ligaments 
when deposited in the gravel together with the shells hence we
have good evidence that the above enumerated gigantic quadrupeds more
different from those of the present day than the oldest of the tertiary
quadrupeds of europe lived whilst the sea was peopled with most of its
present inhabitants and we have confirmed that remarkable law so often
insisted on by mr lyell namely that the longevity of the species in
the mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the testacea 

the great size of the bones of the megatheroid animals including the
megatherium megalonyx scelidotherium and mylodon is truly
wonderful the habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle
to naturalists until professor owen solved the problem with
remarkable ingenuity the teeth indicate by their simple structure 
that these megatheroid animals lived on vegetable food and probably on
the leaves and small twigs of trees their ponderous forms and great
strong curved claws seem so little adapted for locomotion that some
eminent naturalists have actually believed that like the sloths to
which they are intimately related they subsisted by climbing back
downwards on trees and feeding on the leaves it was a bold not to
say preposterous idea to conceive even antediluvian trees with
branches strong enough to bear animals as large as elephants professor
owen with far more probability believes that instead of climbing on
the trees they pulled the branches down to them and tore up the
smaller ones by the roots and so fed on the leaves the colossal
breadth and weight of their hinder quarters which can hardly be
imagined without having been seen become on this view of obvious
service instead of being an incumbrance their apparent clumsiness
disappears with their great tails and their huge heels firmly fixed
like a tripod on the ground they could freely exert the full force of
their most powerful arms and great claws strongly rooted indeed 
must that tree have been which could have resisted such force the
mylodon moreover was furnished with a long extensile tongue like that
of the giraffe which by one of those beautiful provisions of nature 
thus reaches with the aid of its long neck its leafy food i may
remark that in abyssinia the elephant according to bruce when it
cannot reach with its proboscis the branches deeply scores with its
tusks the trunk of the tree up and down and all round till it is
sufficiently weakened to be broken down 

the beds including the above fossil remains stand only from fifteen to
twenty feet above the level of high-water and hence the elevation of
the land has been small without there has been an intercalated period
of subsidence of which we have no evidence since the great quadrupeds
wandered over the surrounding plains and the external features of the
country must then have been very nearly the same as now what it may
naturally be asked was the character of the vegetation at that period 
was the country as wretchedly sterile as it now is as so many of the
co-embedded shells are the same with those now living in the bay i was
at first inclined to think that the former vegetation was probably
similar to the existing one but this would have been an erroneous
inference for some of these same shells live on the luxuriant coast of
brazil and generally the character of the inhabitants of the sea are
useless as guides to judge of those on the land nevertheless from
the following considerations i do not believe that the simple fact of
many gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the plains round bahia blanca 
is any sure guide that they formerly were clothed with a luxuriant
vegetation i have no doubt that the sterile country a little
southward near the rio negro with its scattered thorny trees would
support many and large quadrupeds 


that large animals require a luxuriant vegetation has been a general
assumption which has passed from one work to another but i do not
hesitate to say that it is completely false and that it has vitiated
the reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the
ancient history of the world the prejudice has probably been derived
from india and the indian islands where troops of elephants noble
forests and impenetrable jungles are associated together in every
one s mind if however we refer to any work of travels through the
southern parts of africa we shall find allusions in almost every page
either to the desert character of the country or to the numbers of
large animals inhabiting it the same thing is rendered evident by the
many engravings which have been published of various parts of the
interior when the beagle was at cape town i made an excursion of
some days length into the country which at least was sufficient to
render that which i had read more fully intelligible 

dr andrew smith who at the head of his adventurous party has lately
succeeded in passing the tropic of capricorn informs me that taking
into consideration the whole of the southern part of africa there can
be no doubt of its being a sterile country on the southern and
south-eastern coasts there are some fine forests but with these
exceptions the traveller may pass for days together through open
plains covered by a poor and scanty vegetation it is difficult to
convey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative fertility but it
may be safely said that the amount of vegetation supported at any one
time by great britain exceeds perhaps even tenfold the quantity
on an equal area in the interior parts of southern africa the fact
that bullock-waggons can travel in any direction excepting near the
coast without more than occasionally half an hour s delay in cutting
down bushes gives perhaps a more definite notion of the scantiness
of the vegetation now if we look to the animals inhabiting these
wide plains we shall find their numbers extraordinarily great and
their bulk immense we must enumerate the elephant three species of
rhinoceros and probably according to dr smith two others the
hippopotamus the giraffe the bos caffer as large as a full-grown
bull and the elan but little less two zebras and the quaccha two
gnus and several antelopes even larger than these latter animals it
may be supposed that although the species are numerous the individuals
of each kind are few by the kindness of dr smith i am enabled to
show that the case is very different he informs me that in lat 
degs in one day s march with the bullock-waggons he saw without
wandering to any great distance on either side between one hundred and
one hundred and fifty rhinoceroses which belonged to three species 
the same day he saw several herds of giraffes amounting together to
nearly a hundred and that although no elephant was observed yet they
are found in this district at the distance of a little more than one
hour s march from their place of encampment on the previous night his
party actually killed at one spot eight hippopotamuses and saw many
more in this same river there were likewise crocodiles of course it
was a case quite extraordinary to see so many great animals crowded
together but it evidently proves that they must exist in great
numbers dr smith describes the country passed through that day as
 being thinly covered with grass and bushes about four feet high and
still more thinly with mimosa-trees the waggons were not prevented
travelling in a nearly straight line 

besides these large animals every one the least acquainted with the
natural history of the cape has read of the herds of antelopes which
can be compared only with the flocks of migratory birds the numbers
indeed of the lion panther and hyaena and the multitude of birds of
prey plainly speak of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds one
evening seven lions were counted at the same time prowling round dr 
smith s encampment as this able naturalist remarked to me the
carnage each day in southern africa must indeed be terrific i confess
it is truly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in
a country producing so little food the larger quadrupeds no doubt
roam over wide tracts in search of it and their food chiefly consists
of underwood which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk 
dr smith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth no
sooner is a part consumed than its place is supplied by a fresh stock 
there can be no doubt however that our ideas respecting the apparent
amount of food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much
exaggerated it should have been remembered that the camel an animal
of no mean bulk has always been considered as the emblem of the desert 

the belief that where large quadrupeds exist the vegetation must
necessarily be luxuriant is the more remarkable because the converse
is far from true mr burchell observed to me that when entering
brazil nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the
south american vegetation contrasted with that of south africa 
together with the absence of all large quadrupeds in his travels 
he has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights if
there were sufficient data of an equal number of the largest
herbivorous quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious if
we take on the one side the elephant hippopotamus giraffe bos
caffer elan certainly three and probably five species of rhinoceros 
and on the american side two tapirs the guanaco three deer the
vicuna peccari capybara after which we must choose from the monkeys
to complete the number and then place these two groups alongside each
other it is not easy to conceive ranks more disproportionate in size 
after the above facts we are compelled to conclude against anterior
probability that among the mammalia there exists no close relation
between the bulk of the species and the quantity of the vegetation 
in the countries which they inhabit 

with regard to the number of large quadrupeds there certainly exists
no quarter of the globe which will bear comparison with southern
africa after the different statements which have been given the
extremely desert character of that region will not be disputed in the
european division of the world we must look back to the tertiary
epochs to find a condition of things among the mammalia resembling
that now existing at the cape of good hope those tertiary epochs 
which we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with
large animals because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at
certain spots could hardly boast of more large quadrupeds than
southern africa does at present if we speculate on the condition of
the vegetation during these epochs we are at least bound so far to
consider existing analogies as not to urge as absolutely necessary a
luxuriant vegetation when we see a state of things so totally
different at the cape of good hope 

we know that the extreme regions of north america many degrees
beyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few feet remains
perpetually congealed are covered by forests of large and tall trees 
in a like manner in siberia we have woods of birch fir aspen and
larch growing in a latitude degs where the mean temperature
of the air falls below the freezing point and where the earth is so
completely frozen that the carcass of an animal embedded in it is
perfectly preserved with these facts we must grant as far as
 quantity alone of vegetation is concerned that the great quadrupeds
of the later tertiary epochs might in most parts of northern europe
and asia have lived on the spots where their remains are now found i
do not here speak of the kind of vegetation necessary for their
support because as there is evidence of physical changes and as the
animals have become extinct so may we suppose that the species of
plants have likewise been changed 

these remarks i may be permitted to add directly bear on the case of
the siberian animals preserved in ice the firm conviction of the
necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical
luxuriance to support such large animals and the impossibility of
reconciling this with the proximity of perpetual congelation was one
chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate 
and of overwhelming catastrophes which were invented to account for
their entombment i am far from supposing that the climate has not
changed since the period when those animals lived which now lie buried
in the ice at present i only wish to show that as far as quantity 
of food alone is concerned the ancient rhinoceroses might have
roamed over the steppes of central siberia the northern parts
probably being under water even in their present condition as well as
the living rhinoceroses and elephants over the karros of southern
africa 


i will now give an account of the habits of some of the more
interesting birds which are common on the wild plains of northern
patagonia and first for the largest or south american ostrich the
ordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to every one they live on
vegetable matter such as roots and grass but at bahia blanca i have
repeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the extensive
mud-banks which are then dry for the sake as the gauchos say of
feeding on small fish although the ostrich in its habits is so shy 
wary and solitary and although so fleet in its pace it is caught
without much difficulty by the indian or gaucho armed with the bolas 
when several horsemen appear in a semicircle it becomes confounded 
and does not know which way to escape they generally prefer running
against the wind yet at the first start they expand their wings and
like a vessel make all sail on one fine hot day i saw several
ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes where they squatted concealed 
till quite closely approached it is not generally known that ostriches
readily take to the water mr king informs me that at the bay of san
blas and at port valdes in patagonia he saw these birds swimming
several times from island to island they ran into the water both when
driven down to a point and likewise of their own accord when not
frightened the distance crossed was about two hundred yards when
swimming very little of their bodies appear above water their necks
are extended a little forward and their progress is slow on two
occasions i saw some ostriches swimming across the santa cruz river 
where its course was about four hundred yards wide and the stream
rapid captain sturt when descending the murrumbidgee in
australia saw two emus in the act of swimming 

the inhabitants of the country readily distinguish even at a distance 
the cock bird from the hen the former is larger and darker-coloured 
 and has a bigger head the ostrich i believe the cock emits a
singular deep-toned hissing note when first i heard it standing in
the midst of some sand-hillocks i thought it was made by some wild
beast for it is a sound that one cannot tell whence it comes or from
how far distant when we were at bahia blanca in the months of
september and october the eggs in extraordinary numbers were found
all over the country they lie either scattered and single in which
case they are never hatched and are called by the spaniards huachos 
or they are collected together into a shallow excavation which forms
the nest out of the four nests which i saw three contained
twenty-two eggs each and the fourth twenty-seven in one day s hunting
on horseback sixty-four eggs were found forty-four of these were in
two nests and the remaining twenty scattered huachos the gauchos
unanimously affirm and there is no reason to doubt their statement 
that the male bird alone hatches the eggs and for some time afterwards
accompanies the young the cock when on the nest lies very close i
have myself almost ridden over one it is asserted that at such times
they are occasionally fierce and even dangerous and that they have
been known to attack a man on horseback trying to kick and leap on
him my informer pointed out to me an old man whom he had seen much
terrified by one chasing him i observe in burchell s travels in south
africa that he remarks having killed a male ostrich and the
feathers being dirty it was said by the hottentots to be a nest bird 
i understand that the male emu in the zoological gardens takes charge
of the nest this habit therefore is common to the family 

the gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest i
have been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched
to go in the middle of the day one after the other to the same nest 
i may add also that it is believed in africa that two or more
females lay in one nest although this habit at first appears very
strange i think the cause may be explained in a simple manner the
number of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty and even to
fifty and according to azara some times to seventy or eighty now 
although it is most probable from the number of eggs found in one
district being so extraordinarily great in proportion to the parent
birds and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen that she
may in the course of the season lay a large number yet the time
required must be very long azara states that a female in a
state of domestication laid seventeen eggs each at the interval of
three days one from another if the hen was obliged to hatch her own
eggs before the last was laid the first probably would be addled but
if each laid a few eggs at successive periods in different nests and
several hens as is stated to be the case combined together then the
eggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age if the number
of eggs in one of these nests is as i believe not greater on an
average than the number laid by one female in the season then there
must be as many nests as females and each cock bird will have its fair
share of the labour of incubation and that during a period when the
females probably could not sit from not having finished laying i
have before mentioned the great numbers of huachos or deserted eggs 
so that in one day s hunting twenty were found in this state it
appears odd that so many should be wasted does it not arise from the
difficulty of several females associating together and finding a male
ready to undertake the office of incubation it is evident that there
must at first be some degree of association between at least two
females otherwise the eggs would remain scattered over the wide plain 
at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them into
one nest some authors have believed that the scattered eggs were
deposited for the young birds to feed on this can hardly be the case
in america because the huachos although often found addled and
putrid are generally whole 

when at the rio negro in northern patagonia i repeatedly heard the
gauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called avestruz petise 
they described it as being less than the common ostrich which is there
abundant but with a very close general resemblance they said its
colour was dark and mottled and that its legs were shorter and
feathered lower down than those of the common ostrich it is more
easily caught by the bolas than the other species the few inhabitants
who had seen both kinds affirmed they could distinguish them apart
from a long distance the eggs of the small species appeared however 
more generally known and it was remarked with surprise that they
were very little less than those of the rhea but of a slightly
different form and with a tinge of pale blue this species occurs
most rarely on the plains bordering the rio negro but about a degree
and a half further south they are tolerably abundant when at port
desire in patagonia lat degs mr martens shot an ostrich and
i looked at it forgetting at the moment in the most unaccountable
manner the whole subject of the petises and thought it was a not
full-grown bird of the common sort it was cooked and eaten before my
memory returned fortunately the head neck legs wings many of the
larger feathers and a large part of the skin had been preserved and
from these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together and is
now exhibited in the museum of the zoological society mr gould in
describing this new species has done me the honour of calling it after
my name 

among the patagonian indians in the strait of magellan we found a half
indian who had lived some years with the tribe but had been born in
the northern provinces i asked him if he had ever heard of the
avestruz petise he answered by saying why there are none others in
these southern countries he informed me that the number of eggs in
the nest of the petise is considerably less than in that of the other
kind namely not more than fifteen on an average but he asserted that
more than one female deposited them at santa cruz we saw several of
these birds they were excessively wary i think they could see a
person approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves in
ascending the river few were seen but in our quiet and rapid descent 
many in pairs and by fours or fives were observed it was remarked
that this bird did not expand its wings when first starting at full
speed after the manner of the northern kind in conclusion i may
observe that the struthio rhea inhabits the country of la plata as far
as a little south of the rio negro in lat degs and that the
struthio darwinii takes its place in southern patagonia the part about
the rio negro being neutral territory m a d orbigny when at
the rio negro made great exertions to procure this bird but never had
the good fortune to succeed dobrizhoffer long ago was aware of
there being two kinds of ostriches he says you must know moreover 
that emus differ in size and habits in different tracts of land for
those that inhabit the plains of buenos ayres and tucuman are larger 
and have black white and grey feathers those near to the strait of
magellan are smaller and more beautiful for their white feathers are
tipped with black at the extremity and their black ones in like manner
terminate in white 

a very singular little bird tinochorus rumicivorus is here common in
its habits and general appearance it nearly equally partakes of the
characters different as they are of the quail and snipe the
tinochorus is found in the whole of southern south america wherever
there are sterile plains or open dry pasture land it frequents in
pairs or small flocks the most desolate places where scarcely another
living creature can exist upon being approached they squat close and
then are very difficult to be distinguished from the ground when
feeding they walk rather slowly with their legs wide apart they dust
themselves in roads and sandy places and frequent particular spots 
where they may be found day after day like partridges they take wing
in a flock in all these respects in the muscular gizzard adapted for
vegetable food in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils short legs and
form of foot the tinochorus has a close affinity with quails but as
soon as the bird is seen flying its whole appearance changes the long
pointed wings so different from those in the gallinaceous order the
irregular manner of flight and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of
rising recall the idea of a snipe the sportsmen of the beagle
unanimously called it the short-billed snipe to this genus or rather
to the family of the waders its skeleton shows that it is really
related 

the tinochorus is closely related to some other south american birds 
two species of the genus attagis are in almost every respect ptarmigans
in their habits one lives in tierra del fuego above the limits of the
forest land and the other just beneath the snow-line on the cordillera
of central chile a bird of another closely allied genus chionis
alba is an inhabitant of the antarctic regions it feeds on sea-weed
and shells on the tidal rocks although not web footed from some
unaccountable habit it is frequently met with far out at sea this
small family of birds is one of those which from its varied relations
to other families although at present offering only difficulties to
the systematic naturalist ultimately may assist in revealing the grand
scheme common to the present and past ages on which organized beings
have been created 

the genus furnarius contains several species all small birds living
on the ground and inhabiting open dry countries in structure they
cannot be compared to any european form ornithologists have generally
included them among the creepers although opposed to that family in
every habit the best known species is the common oven-bird of la
plata the casara or housemaker of the spaniards the nest whence it
takes its name is placed in the most exposed situations as on the top
of a post a bare rock or on a cactus it is composed of mud and bits
of straw and has strong thick walls in shape it precisely resembles
an oven or depressed beehive the opening is large and arched and
directly in front within the nest there is a partition which reaches
nearly to the roof thus forming a passage or antechamber to the true
nest 

another and smaller species of furnarius f cunicularius resembles
the oven-bird in the general reddish tint of its plumage in a peculiar
shrill reiterated cry and in an odd manner of running by starts from
its affinity the spaniards call it casarita or little housebuilder 
although its nidification is quite different the casarita builds its
nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole which is said to
extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground several of the
country people told me that when boys they had attempted to dig out
the nest but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the
passage the bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side
of a road or stream here at bahia blanca the walls round the houses
are built of hardened mud and i noticed that one which enclosed a
courtyard where i lodged was bored through by round holes in a score
of places on asking the owner the cause of this he bitterly
complained of the little casarita several of which i afterwards
observed at work it is rather curious to find how incapable these
birds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness for although they
were constantly flitting over the low wall they continued vainly to
bore through it thinking it an excellent bank for their nests i do
not doubt that each bird as often as it came to daylight on the
opposite side was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact 

i have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this
country of armadilloes three species occur namely the dasypus
minutus or pichy the d villosus or peludo and the apar the
first extends ten degrees further south than any other kind a fourth
species the mulita does not come as far south as bahia blanca the
four species have nearly similar habits the peludo however is
nocturnal while the others wander by day over the open plains feeding
on beetles larvae roots and even small snakes the apar commonly
called mataco is remarkable by having only three moveable bands the
rest of its tesselated covering being nearly inflexible it has the
power of rolling itself into a perfect sphere like one kind of english
woodlouse in this state it is safe from the attack of dogs for the
dog not being able to take the whole in its mouth tries to bite one
side and the ball slips away the smooth hard covering of the
 mataco offers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog 
the pichy prefers a very dry soil and the sand-dunes near the coast 
where for many months it can never taste water is its favourite
resort it often tries to escape notice by squatting close to the
ground in the course of a day s ride near bahia blanca several were
generally met with the instant one was perceived it was necessary 
in order to catch it almost to tumble off one s horse for in soft
soil the animal burrowed so quickly that its hinder quarters would
almost disappear before one could alight it seems almost a pity to
kill such nice little animals for as a gaucho said while sharpening
his knife on the back of one son tan mansos they are so quiet 

of reptiles there are many kinds one snake a trigonocephalus or
cophias from the size of the poison channel in its fangs must
be very deadly cuvier in opposition to some other naturalists makes
this a sub-genus of the rattlesnake and intermediate between it and
the viper in confirmation of this opinion i observed a fact which
appears to me very curious and instructive as showing how every
character even though it may be in some degree independent of
structure has a tendency to vary by slow degrees the extremity of the
tail of this snake is terminated by a point which is very slightly
enlarged and as the animal glides along it constantly vibrates the
last inch and this part striking against the dry grass and brushwood 
produces a rattling noise which can be distinctly heard at the
distance of six feet as often as the animal was irritated or
surprised its tail was shaken and the vibrations were extremely
rapid even as long as the body retained its irritability a tendency
to this habitual movement was evident this trigonocephalus has 
therefore in some respects the structure of a viper with the habits
of a rattlesnake the noise however being produced by a simpler
device the expression of this snake s face was hideous and fierce 
the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris 
the jaws were broad at the base and the nose terminated in a
triangular projection i do not think i ever saw anything more ugly 
excepting perhaps some of the vampire bats i imagine this repulsive
aspect originates from the features being placed in positions with
respect to each other somewhat proportional to those of the human
face and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness 

amongst the batrachian reptiles i found only one little toad
 phryniscus nigricans which was most singular from its colour if we
imagine first that it had been steeped in the blackest ink and then 
when dry allowed to crawl over a board freshly painted with the
brightest vermilion so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of
its stomach a good idea of its appearance will be gained if it had
been an unnamed species surely it ought to have been called
 diabolicus for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of eve instead
of being nocturnal in its habits as other toads are and living in
damp obscure recesses it crawls during the heat of the day about the
dry sand-hillocks and arid plains where not a single drop of water can
be found it must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture and
this probably is absorbed by the skin for it is known that these
reptiles possess great powers of cutaneous absorption at maldonado i
found one in a situation nearly as dry as at bahia blanca and thinking
to give it a great treat carried it to a pool of water not only was
the little animal unable to swim but i think without help it would
soon have been drowned of lizards there were many kinds but only one
 proctotretus multimaculatus remarkable from its habits it lives on
the bare sand near the sea coast and from its mottled colour the
brownish scales being speckled with white yellowish red and dirty
blue can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface when
frightened it attempts to avoid discovery by feigning death with
outstretched legs depressed body and closed eyes if further
molested it buries itself with great quickness in the loose sand this
lizard from its flattened body and short legs cannot run quickly 

i will here add a few remarks on the hybernation of animals in this
part of south america when we first arrived at bahia blanca 
september th we thought nature had granted scarcely a living
creature to this sandy and dry country by digging however in the
ground several insects large spiders and lizards were found in a
half-torpid state on the th a few animals began to appear and by
the th three days from the equinox everything announced the
commencement of spring the plains were ornamented by the flowers of a
pink wood-sorrel wild peas cenotherae and geraniums and the birds
began to lay their eggs numerous lamellicorn and heteromerous
insects the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies were
slowly crawling about while the lizard tribe the constant inhabitants
of a sandy soil darted about in every direction during the first
eleven days whilst nature was dormant the mean temperature taken from
observations made every two hours on board the beagle was degs 
and in the middle of the day the thermometer seldom ranged above 
degs on the eleven succeeding days in which all living things became
so animated the mean was degs and the range in the middle of the
day between and degs here then an increase of seven degrees
in mean temperature but a greater one of extreme heat was sufficient
to awake the functions of life at monte video from which we had just
before sailed in the twenty-three days included between the th of
july and the th of august the mean temperature from observations
was degs the mean hottest day being degs and the coldest
 degs the lowest point to which the thermometer fell was 
degs and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to or 
degs yet with this high temperature almost every beetle several
genera of spiders snails and land-shells toads and lizards were all
lying torpid beneath stones but we have seen that at bahia blanca 
which is four degrees southward and therefore with a climate only a
very little colder this same temperature with a rather less extreme
heat was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings this shows
how nicely the stimulus required to arouse hybernating animals is
governed by the usual climate of the district and not by the absolute
heat it is well known that within the tropics the hybernation or
more properly aestivation of animals is determined not by the
temperature but by the times of drought near rio de janeiro i was
at first surprised to observe that a few days after some little
depressions had been filled with water they were peopled by numerous
full-grown shells and beetles which must have been lying dormant 
humboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been
erected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened
mud he adds the indians often find enormous boas which they call
uji or water serpents in the same lethargic state to reanimate them 
they must be irritated or wetted with water 

i will only mention one other animal a zoophyte i believe virgularia
patagonica a kind of sea-pen it consists of a thin straight 
fleshy stem with alternate rows of polypi on each side and
surrounding an elastic stony axis varying in length from eight inches
to two feet the stem at one extremity is truncate but at the other
is terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage the stony axis which
gives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere
vessel filled with granular matter at low water hundreds of these
zoophytes might be seen projecting like stubble with the truncate end
upwards a few inches above the surface of the muddy sand when
touched or pulled they suddenly drew themselves in with force so as
nearly or quite to disappear by this action the highly elastic axis
must be bent at the lower extremity where it is naturally slightly
curved and i imagine it is by this elasticity alone that the zoophyte
is enabled to rise again through the mud each polypus though closely
united to its brethren has a distinct mouth body and tentacula of
these polypi in a large specimen there must be many thousands yet we
see that they act by one movement they have also one central axis
connected with a system of obscure circulation and the ova are
produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals well
may one be allowed to ask what is an individual it is always
interesting to discover the foundation of the strange tales of the old
voyagers and i have no doubt but that the habits of this virgularia
explain one such case captain lancaster in his voyage in 
narrates that on the sea-sands of the island of sombrero in the east
indies he found a small twig growing up like a young tree and on
offering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the ground and sinks 
unless held very hard on being plucked up a great worm is found to
be its root and as the tree groweth in greatness so doth the worm
diminish and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into a tree it
rooteth in the earth and so becomes great this transformation is one
of the strangest wonders that i saw in all my travels for if this tree
is plucked up while young and the leaves and bark stripped off it
becomes a hard stone when dry much like white coral thus is this worm
twice transformed into different natures of these we gathered and
brought home many 


during my stay at bahia blanca while waiting for the beagle the place
was in a constant state of excitement from rumours of wars and
victories between the troops of rosas and the wild indians one day
an account came that a small party forming one of the postas on the
line to buenos ayres had been found all murdered the next day three
hundred men arrived from the colorado under the command of commandant
miranda a large portion of these men were indians mansos or tame 
belonging to the tribe of the cacique bernantio they passed the night
here and it was impossible to conceive anything more wild and savage
than the scene of their bivouac some drank till they were
intoxicated others swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle
slaughtered for their suppers and then being sick from drunkenness 
they cast it up again and were besmeared with filth and gore 

nam simul expletus dapibus vinoque sepultus cervicem inflexam posuit 
jacuitque per antrum immensus saniem eructans ac frusta cruenta per
somnum commixta mero 

in the morning they started for the scene of the murder with orders to
follow the rastro or track even if it led them to chile we
subsequently heard that the wild indians had escaped into the great
pampas and from some cause the track had been missed one glance at
the rastro tells these people a whole history supposing they examine
the track of a thousand horses they will soon guess the number of
mounted ones by seeing how many have cantered by the depth of the
other impressions whether any horses were loaded with cargoes by the
irregularity of the footsteps how far tired by the manner in which
the food has been cooked whether the pursued travelled in haste by
the general appearance how long it has been since they passed they
consider a rastro of ten days or a fortnight quite recent enough to be
hunted out we also heard that miranda struck from the west end of the
sierra ventana in a direct line to the island of cholechel situated
seventy leagues up the rio negro this is a distance of between two
and three hundred miles through a country completely unknown what
other troops in the world are so independent with the sun for their
guide mare s flesh for food their saddle-cloths for beds as long as
there is a little water these men would penetrate to the end of the
world 

a few days afterwards i saw another troop of these banditti-like
soldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of indians at the small
salinas who had been betrayed by a prisoner cacique the spaniard who
brought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man he
gave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present some
indians who had been taken prisoners gave information of a tribe
living north of the colorado two hundred soldiers were sent and they
first discovered the indians by a cloud of dust from their horses 
feet as they chanced to be travelling the country was mountainous
and wild and it must have been far in the interior for the cordillera
were in sight the indians men women and children were about one
hundred and ten in number and they were nearly all taken or killed 
for the soldiers sabre every man the indians are now so terrified
that they offer no resistance in a body but each flies neglecting
even his wife and children but when overtaken like wild animals they
fight against any number to the last moment one dying indian seized
with his teeth the thumb of his adversary and allowed his own eye to
be forced out sooner than relinquish his hold another who was
wounded feigned death keeping a knife ready to strike one more fatal
blow my informer said when he was pursuing an indian the man cried
out for mercy at the same time that he was covertly loosing the bolas
from his waist meaning to whirl it round his head and so strike his
pursuer i however struck him with my sabre to the ground and then
got off my horse and cut his throat with my knife this is a dark
picture but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact that
all the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold
blood when i exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman he answered 
 why what can be done they breed so 

every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war 
because it is against barbarians who would believe in this age that
such atrocities could be committed in a christian civilized country 
the children of the indians are saved to be sold or given away as
servants or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can make
them believe themselves slaves but i believe in their treatment there
is little to complain of 

in the battle four men ran away together they were pursued one was
killed and the other three were taken alive they turned out to be
messengers or ambassadors from a large body of indians united in the
common cause of defence near the cordillera the tribe to which they
had been sent was on the point of holding a grand council the feast of
mare s flesh was ready and the dance prepared in the morning the
ambassadors were to have returned to the cordillera they were
remarkably fine men very fair above six feet high and all under
thirty years of age the three survivors of course possessed very
valuable information and to extort this they were placed in a line the
two first being questioned answered no se i do not know and were
one after the other shot the third also said no se adding fire 
i am a man and can die not one syllable would they breathe to injure
the united cause of their country the conduct of the above-mentioned
cacique was very different he saved his life by betraying the intended
plan of warfare and the point of union in the andes it was believed
that there were already six or seven hundred indians together and that
in summer their numbers would be doubled ambassadors were to have been
sent to the indians at the small salinas near bahia blanca whom i
have mentioned that this same cacique had betrayed the communication 
therefore between the indians extends from the cordillera to the
coast of the atlantic 

general rosas s plan is to kill all stragglers and having driven the
remainder to a common point to attack them in a body in the summer 
with the assistance of the chilenos this operation is to be repeated
for three successive years i imagine the summer is chosen as the time
for the main attack because the plains are then without water and the
indians can only travel in particular directions the escape of the
indians to the south of the rio negro where in such a vast unknown
country they would be safe is prevented by a treaty with the
tehuelches to this effect that rosas pays them so much to slaughter
every indian who passes to the south of the river but if they fail in
so doing they themselves are to be exterminated the war is waged
chiefly against the indians near the cordillera for many of the tribes
on this eastern side are fighting with rosas the general however 
like lord chesterfield thinking that his friends may in a future day
become his enemies always places them in the front ranks so that
their numbers may be thinned since leaving south america we have
heard that this war of extermination completely failed 

among the captive girls taken in the same engagement there were two
very pretty spanish ones who had been carried away by the indians when
young and could now only speak the indian tongue from their account
they must have come from salta a distance in a straight line of nearly
one thousand miles this gives one a grand idea of the immense
territory over which the indians roam yet great as it is i think
there will not in another half-century be a wild indian northward of
the rio negro the warfare is too bloody to last the christians
killing every indian and the indians doing the same by the christians 
it is melancholy to trace how the indians have given way before the
spanish invaders schirdel says that in when buenos ayres
was founded there were villages containing two and three thousand
inhabitants even in falconer s time the indians made inroads
as far as luxan areco and arrecife but now they are driven beyond
the salado not only have whole tribes been exterminated but the
remaining indians have become more barbarous instead of living in
large villages and being employed in the arts of fishing as well as
of the chase they now wander about the open plains without home or
fixed occupation 

i heard also some account of an engagement which took place a few
weeks previously to the one mentioned at cholechel this is a very
important station on account of being a pass for horses and it was in
consequence for some time the head-quarters of a division of the army 
when the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of indians of
whom they killed twenty or thirty the cacique escaped in a manner
which astonished every one the chief indians always have one or two
picked horses which they keep ready for any urgent occasion on one
of these an old white horse the cacique sprung taking with him his
little son the horse had neither saddle nor bridle to avoid the
shots the indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation namely 
with an arm round the horse s neck and one leg only on its back thus
hanging on one side he was seen patting the horse s head and talking
to him the pursuers urged every effort in the chase the commandant
three times changed his horse but all in vain the old indian father
and his son escaped and were free what a fine picture one can form
in one s mind the naked bronze-like figure of the old man with his
little boy riding like a mazeppa on the white horse thus leaving far
behind him the host of his pursuers 

i saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint which i
immediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow 
he told me it was found near the island of cholechel and that they are
frequently picked up there it was between two and three inches long 
and therefore twice as large as those now used in tierra del fuego it
was made of opaque cream-coloured flint but the point and barbs had
been intentionally broken off it is well known that no pampas indians
now use bows and arrows i believe a small tribe in banda oriental
must be excepted but they are widely separated from the pampas
indians and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest and
live on foot it appears therefore that these arrow-heads are
antiquarian relics of the indians before the great change in
habits consequent on the introduction of the horse into south america 

 since this was written m alcide d orbingy has examined these
shells and pronounces them all to be recent 

 m aug bravard has described in a spanish work observaciones
geologicas this district and he believes that the bones of
the extinct mammals were washed out of the underlying pampean deposit 
and subsequently became embedded with the still existing shells but i
am not convinced by his remarks m bravard believes that the whole
enormous pampean deposit is a sub-aerial formation like sand-dunes 
this seems to me to be an untenable doctrine

 the elephant which was killed at exeter change was estimated being
partly weighed at five tons and a half the elephant actress as i was
informed weighed one ton less so that we may take five as the average
of a full-grown elephant i was told at the surry gardens that a
hippopotamus which was sent to england cut up into pieces was estimated
at three tons and a half we will call it three from these premises
we may give three tons and a half to each of the five rhinoceroses 
perhaps a ton to the giraffe and half to the bos caffer as well as to
the elan a large ox weighs from to pounds this will give
an average from the above estimates of of a ton for the ten
largest herbivorous animals of southern africa in south america 
allowing pounds for the two tapirs together for the guanaco
and vicuna for three deer for the capybara peccari and a
monkey we shall have an average of pounds which i believe is
overstating the result the ratio will therefore be as to or
 to for the ten largest animals from the two continents

consisted of rounded semi-transparent irregular grains aggregated
together into particles of various sizes all such particles and the
separate grains possessed the power of rapid movement generally
revolving around different axes but sometimes progressive the
movement was visible with a very weak power but even with the highest
its cause could not be perceived it was very different from the

bahia blanca to buenos ayres

set out for buenos ayres rio sauce sierra ventana third
posta driving horses bolas partridges and foxes features of the
country long-legged plover teru-tero hail-storm natural enclosures
in the sierra tapalguen flesh of puma meat diet guardia del
monte effects of cattle on the vegetation cardoon buenos
ayres corral where cattle are slaughtered 


september th i hired a gaucho to accompany me on my ride to buenos
ayres though with some difficulty as the father of one man was afraid
to let him go and another who seemed willing was described to me as
so fearful that i was afraid to take him for i was told that even if
he saw an ostrich at a distance he would mistake it for an indian and
would fly like the wind away the distance to buenos ayres is about
four hundred miles and nearly the whole way through an uninhabited
country we started early in the morning ascending a few hundred feet
from the basin of green turf on which bahia blanca stands we entered
on a wide desolate plain it consists of a crumbling
argillaceo-calcareous rock which from the dry nature of the climate 
supports only scattered tufts of withered grass without a single bush
or tree to break the monotonous uniformity the weather was fine but
the atmosphere remarkably hazy i thought the appearance foreboded a
gale but the gauchos said it was owing to the plain at some great
distance in the interior being on fire after a long gallop having
changed horses twice we reached the rio sauce it is a deep rapid 
little stream not above twenty-five feet wide the second posta on
the road to buenos ayres stands on its banks a little above there is a
ford for horses where the water does not reach to the horses belly 
but from that point in its course to the sea it is quite impassable 
and hence makes a most useful barrier against the indians 

insignificant as this stream is the jesuit falconer whose information
is generally so very correct figures it as a considerable river 
rising at the foot of the cordillera with respect to its source i do
not doubt that this is the case for the gauchos assured me that in the
middle of the dry summer this stream at the same time with the
colorado has periodical floods which can only originate in the snow
melting on the andes it is extremely improbable that a stream so
small as the sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the
continent and indeed if it were the residue of a large river its
waters as in other ascertained cases would be saline during the
winter we must look to the springs round the sierra ventana as the
source of its pure and limpid stream i suspect the plains of
patagonia like those of australia are traversed by many water-courses
which only perform their proper parts at certain periods probably this
is the case with the water which flows into the head of port desire 
and likewise with the rio chupat on the banks of which masses of
highly cellular scoriae were found by the officers employed in the
survey 

as it was early in the afternoon when we arrived we took fresh horses 
and a soldier for a guide and started for the sierra de la ventana 
this mountain is visible from the anchorage at bahia blanca and capt 
fitz roy calculates its height to be feet an altitude very
remarkable on this eastern side of the continent i am not aware that
any foreigner previous to my visit had ascended this mountain and
indeed very few of the soldiers at bahia blanca knew anything about it 
hence we heard of beds of coal of gold and silver of caves and of
forests all of which inflamed my curiosity only to disappoint it the
distance from the posta was about six leagues over a level plain of the
same character as before the ride was however interesting as the
mountain began to show its true form when we reached the foot of the
main ridge we had much difficulty in finding any water and we thought
we should have been obliged to have passed the night without any at
last we discovered some by looking close to the mountain for at the
distance even of a few hundred yards the streamlets were buried and
entirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus i do
not think nature ever made a more solitary desolate pile of rock it
well deserves its name of hurtado or separated the mountain is
steep extremely rugged and broken and so entirely destitute of
trees and even bushes that we actually could not make a skewer to
stretch out our meat over the fire of thistle-stalks the strange
aspect of this mountain is contrasted by the sea-like plain which not
only abuts against its steep sides but likewise separates the parallel
ranges the uniformity of the colouring gives an extreme quietness to
the view the whitish grey of the quartz rock and the light brown of
the withered grass of the plain being unrelieved by any brighter tint 
from custom one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and
bold mountain a broken country strewed over with huge fragments here
nature shows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is
changed into dry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity under these
circumstances i was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any
pebbles could be found on the shores of bahia blanca and near the
settlement there were some of quartz which certainly must have come
from this source the distance is forty-five miles 

the dew which in the early part of the night wetted the saddle-cloths
under which we slept was in the morning frozen the plain though
appearing horizontal had insensibly sloped up to a height of between
 and feet above the sea in the morning th of september the
guide told me to ascend the nearest ridge which he thought would lead
me to the four peaks that crown the summit the climbing up such rough
rocks was very fatiguing the sides were so indented that what was
gained in one five minutes was often lost in the next at last when i
reached the ridge my disappointment was extreme in finding a
precipitous valley as deep as the plain which cut the chain
transversely in two and separated me from the four points this
valley is very narrow but flat-bottomed and it forms a fine
horse-pass for the indians as it connects the plains on the northern
and southern sides of the range having descended and while crossing
it i saw two horses grazing i immediately hid myself in the long
grass and began to reconnoitre but as i could see no signs of indians
i proceeded cautiously on my second ascent it was late in the day 
and this part of the mountain like the other was steep and rugged i
was on the top of the second peak by two o clock but got there with
extreme difficulty every twenty yards i had the cramp in the upper
part of both thighs so that i was afraid i should not have been able
to have got down again it was also necessary to return by another
road as it was out of the question to pass over the saddle-back i
was therefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks their altitude
was but little greater and every purpose of geology had been answered 
so that the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion i
presume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of
muscular action from that of hard riding to that of still harder
climbing it is a lesson worth remembering as in some cases it might
cause much difficulty 

i have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock and
with it a little glossy clay-slate is associated at the height of a
few hundred feet above the plain patches of conglomerate adhered in
several places to the solid rock they resembled in hardness and in
the nature of the cement the masses which may be seen daily forming on
some coasts i do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner
aggregated at a period when the great calcareous formation was
depositing beneath the surrounding sea we may believe that the jagged
and battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the effects of the waves
of an open ocean 

i was on the whole disappointed with this ascent even the view was
insignificant a plain like the sea but without its beautiful colour
and defined outline the scene however was novel and a little
danger like salt to meat gave it a relish that the danger was very
little was certain for my two companions made a good fire a thing
which is never done when it is suspected that indians are near i
reached the place of our bivouac by sunset and drinking much mate and
smoking several cigaritos soon made up my bed for the night the wind
was very strong and cold but i never slept more comfortably 

september th in the morning having fairly scudded before the gale 
we arrived by the middle of the day at the sauce posta in the road we
saw great numbers of deer and near the mountain a guanaco the plain 
which abuts against the sierra is traversed by some curious gullies 
of which one was about twenty feet wide and at least thirty deep we
were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we
could find a pass we stayed the night at the posta the conversation 
as was generally the case being about the indians the sierra ventana
was formerly a great place of resort and three or four years ago there
was much fighting there my guide had been present when many indians
were killed the women escaped to the top of the ridge and fought most
desperately with great stones many thus saving themselves 

september th proceeded to the third posta in company with the
lieutenant who commanded it the distance is called fifteen leagues 
but it is only guess-work and is generally overstated the road was
uninteresting over a dry grassy plain and on our left hand at a
greater or less distance there were some low hills a continuation of
which we crossed close to the posta before our arrival we met a large
herd of cattle and horses guarded by fifteen soldiers but we were
told many had been lost it is very difficult to drive animals across
the plains for if in the night a puma or even a fox approaches 
nothing can prevent the horses dispersing in every direction and a
storm will have the same effect a short time since an officer left
buenos ayres with five hundred horses and when he arrived at the army
he had under twenty 

soon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust that a party of
horsemen were coming towards us when far distant my companions knew
them to be indians by their long hair streaming behind their backs 
the indians generally have a fillet round their heads but never any
covering and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces 
heightens to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance they
turned out to be a party of bernantio s friendly tribe going to a
salina for salt the indians eat much salt their children sucking it
like sugar this habit is very different from that of the spanish
gauchos who leading the same kind of life eat scarcely any 
according to mungo park it is people who live on vegetable food
who have an unconquerable desire for salt the indians gave us
good-humoured nods as they passed at full gallop driving before them a
troop of horses and followed by a train of lanky dogs 

september th and th i stayed at this posta two days waiting for
a troop of soldiers which general rosas had the kindness to send to
inform me would shortly travel to buenos ayres and he advised me to
take the opportunity of the escort in the morning we rode to some
neighbouring hills to view the country and to examine the geology 
after dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a
trial of skill with the bolas two spears were stuck in the ground
twenty-five yards apart but they were struck and entangled only once
in four or five times the balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards 
but with little certainty this however does not apply to a man on
horseback for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the
arm it is said that they can be whirled with effect to the distance
of eighty yards as a proof of their force i may mention that at the
falkland islands when the spaniards murdered some of their own
countrymen and all the englishmen a young friendly spaniard was
running away when a great tall man by name luciano came at full
gallop after him shouting to him to stop and saying that he only
wanted to speak to him just as the spaniard was on the point of
reaching the boat luciano threw the balls they struck him on the legs
with such a jerk as to throw him down and to render him for some time
insensible the man after luciano had had his talk was allowed to
escape he told us that his legs were marked by great weals where the
thong had wound round as if he had been flogged with a whip in the
middle of the day two men arrived who brought a parcel from the next
posta to be forwarded to the general so that besides these two our
party consisted this evening of my guide and self the lieutenant and
his four soldiers the latter were strange beings the first a fine
young negro the second half indian and negro and the two others
non-descripts namely an old chilian miner the colour of mahogany 
and another partly a mulatto but two such mongrels with such
detestable expressions i never saw before at night when they were
sitting round the fire and playing at cards i retired to view such a
salvator rosa scene they were seated under a low cliff so that i
could look down upon them around the party were lying dogs arms 
remnants of deer and ostriches and their long spears were stuck in the
turf further in the dark background their horses were tied up ready
for any sudden danger if the stillness of the desolate plain was
broken by one of the dogs barking a soldier leaving the fire would
place his head close to the ground and thus slowly scan the horizon 
even if the noisy teru-tero uttered its scream there would be a pause
in the conversation and every head for a moment a little inclined 

what a life of misery these men appear to us to lead they were at
least ten leagues from the sauce posta and since the murder committed
by the indians twenty from another the indians are supposed to have
made their attack in the middle of the night for very early in the
morning after the murder they were luckily seen approaching this
posta the whole party here however escaped together with the troop
of horses each one taking a line for himself and driving with him as
many animals as he was able to manage 

the little hovel built of thistle-stalks in which they slept neither
kept out the wind nor rain indeed in the latter case the only effect
the roof had was to condense it into larger drops they had nothing
to eat excepting what they could catch such as ostriches deer 
armadilloes etc and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a small
plant somewhat resembling an aloe the sole luxury which these men
enjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars and sucking mate i used
to think that the carrion vultures man s constant attendants on these
dreary plains while seated on the little neighbouring cliffs seemed by
their very patience to say ah when the indians come we shall have a
feast 

in the morning we all sallied forth to hunt and although we had not
much success there were some animated chases soon after starting the
party separated and so arranged their plans that at a certain time of
the day in guessing which they show much skill they should all meet
from different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground and
thus drive together the wild animals one day i went out hunting at
bahia blanca but the men there merely rode in a crescent each being
about a quarter of a mile apart from the other a fine male ostrich
being turned by the headmost riders tried to escape on one side the
gauchos pursued at a reckless pace twisting their horses about with
the most admirable command and each man whirling the balls round his
head at length the foremost threw them revolving through the air in
an instant the ostrich rolled over and over its legs fairly lashed
together by the thong the plains abound with three kinds of partridge 
 two of which are as large as hen pheasants their destroyer a
small and pretty fox was also singularly numerous in the course of
the day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty they were
generally near their earths but the dogs killed one when we returned
to the posta we found two of the party returned who had been hunting
by themselves they had killed a puma and had found an ostrich s nest
with twenty-seven eggs in it each of these is said to equal in weight
eleven hen s eggs so that we obtained from this one nest as much food
as hen s eggs would have given 

september th as the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to
return and we should together make a party of five and all armed i
determined not to wait for the expected troops my host the
lieutenant pressed me much to stop as he had been very obliging not
only providing me with food but lending me his private horses i
wanted to make him some remuneration i asked my guide whether i might
do so but he told me certainly not that the only answer i should
receive probably would be we have meat for the dogs in our country 
and therefore do not grudge it to a christian it must not be supposed
that the rank of lieutenant in such an army would at all prevent the
acceptance of payment it was only the high sense of hospitality which
every traveller is bound to acknowledge as nearly universal throughout
these provinces after galloping some leagues we came to a low swampy
country which extends for nearly eighty miles northward as far as the
sierra tapalguen in some parts there were fine damp plains covered
with grass while others had a soft black and peaty soil there were
also many extensive but shallow lakes and large beds of reeds the
country on the whole resembled the better parts of the cambridgeshire
fens at night we had some difficulty in finding amidst the swamps a
dry place for our bivouac 

september th rose very early in the morning and shortly after
passed the posta where the indians had murdered the five soldiers the
officer had eighteen chuzo wounds in his body by the middle of the
day after a hard gallop we reached the fifth posta on account of
some difficulty in procuring horses we stayed there the night as this
point was the most exposed on the whole line twenty-one soldiers were
stationed here at sunset they returned from hunting bringing with
them seven deer three ostriches and many armadilloes and partridges 
when riding through the country it is a common practice to set fire to
the plain and hence at night as on this occasion the horizon was
illuminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations this is done
partly for the sake of puzzling any stray indians but chiefly for
improving the pasture in grassy plains unoccupied by the larger
ruminating quadrupeds it seems necessary to remove the superfluous
vegetation by fire so as to render the new year s growth serviceable 

the rancho at this place did not boast even of a roof but merely
consisted of a ring of thistle-stalks to break the force of the wind 
it was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake 
swarming with wild fowl among which the black-necked swan was
conspicuous 

the kind of plover which appears as if mounted on stilts himantopus
nigricollis is here common in flocks of considerable size it has
been wrongfully accused of inelegance when wading about in shallow
water which is its favourite resort its gait is far from awkward 
these birds in a flock utter a noise that singularly resembles the cry
of a pack of small dogs in full chase waking in the night i have more
than once been for a moment startled at the distant sound the
teru-tero vanellus cayanus is another bird which often disturbs the
stillness of the night in appearance and habits it resembles in many
respects our peewits its wings however are armed with sharp spurs 
like those on the legs of the common cock as our peewit takes its
name from the sound of its voice so does the teru-tero while riding
over the grassy plains one is constantly pursued by these birds which
appear to hate mankind and i am sure deserve to be hated for their
never-ceasing unvaried harsh screams to the sportsman they are most
annoying by telling every other bird and animal of his approach to
the traveller in the country they may possibly as molina says do
good by warning him of the midnight robber during the breeding
season they attempt like our peewits by feigning to be wounded to
draw away from their nests dogs and other enemies the eggs of this
bird are esteemed a great delicacy 

september th to the seventh posta at the foot of the sierra
tapalguen the country was quite level with a coarse herbage and a
soft peaty soil the hovel was here remarkably neat the posts and
rafters being made of about a dozen dry thistle-stalks bound together
with thongs of hide and by the support of these ionic-like columns 
the roof and sides were thatched with reeds we were here told a fact 
which i would not have credited if i had not had partly ocular proof
of it namely that during the previous night hail as large as small
apples and extremely hard had fallen with such violence as to kill
the greater number of the wild animals one of the men had already
found thirteen deer cervus campestris lying dead and i saw their
 fresh hides another of the party a few minutes after my arrival
brought in seven more now i well know that one man without dogs
could hardly have killed seven deer in a week the men believed they
had seen about fifteen ostriches part of one of which we had for
dinner and they said that several were running about evidently blind
in one eye numbers of smaller birds as ducks hawks and partridges 
were killed i saw one of the latter with a black mark on its back as
if it had been struck with a paving-stone a fence of thistle-stalks
round the hovel was nearly broken down and my informer putting his
head out to see what was the matter received a severe cut and now
wore a bandage the storm was said to have been of limited extent we
certainly saw from our last night s bivouac a dense cloud and lightning
in this direction it is marvellous how such strong animals as deer
could thus have been killed but i have no doubt from the evidence i
have given that the story is not in the least exaggerated i am glad 
however to have its credibility supported by the jesuit dobrizhoffen 
 who speaking of a country much to the northward says hail fell
of an enormous size and killed vast numbers of cattle the indians
hence called the place lalegraicavalca meaning the little white
things dr malcolmson also informs me that he witnessed in in
india a hail-storm which killed numbers of large birds and much
injured the cattle these hailstones were flat and one was ten inches
in circumference and another weighed two ounces they ploughed up a
gravel-walk like musket-balls and passed through glass-windows making
round holes but not cracking them 

having finished our dinner of hail-stricken meat we crossed the
sierra tapalguen a low range of hills a few hundred feet in height 
which commences at cape corrientes the rock in this part is pure
quartz further eastward i understand it is granitic the hills are of
a remarkable form they consist of flat patches of table-land 
surrounded by low perpendicular cliffs like the outliers of a
sedimentary deposit the hill which i ascended was very small not
above a couple of hundred yards in diameter but i saw others larger 
one which goes by the name of the corral is said to be two or three
miles in diameter and encompassed by perpendicular cliffs between
thirty and forty feet high excepting at one spot where the entrance
lies falconer gives a curious account of the indians driving
troops of wild horses into it and then by guarding the entrance 
keeping them secure i have never heard of any other instance of
table-land in a formation of quartz and which in the hill i examined 
had neither cleavage nor stratification i was told that the rock of
the corral was white and would strike fire 

we did not reach the posta on the rio tapalguen till after it was dark 
at supper from something which was said i was suddenly struck with
horror at thinking that i was eating one of the favourite dishes of the
country namely a half-formed calf long before its proper time of
birth it turned out to be puma the meat is very white and remarkably
like veal in taste dr shaw was laughed at for stating that the
flesh of the lion is in great esteem having no small affinity with
veal both in colour taste and flavour such certainly is the case
with the puma the gauchos differ in their opinion whether the jaguar
is good eating but are unanimous in saying that cat is excellent 

september th we followed the course of the rio tapalguen through a
very fertile country to the ninth posta tapalguen itself or the
town of tapalguen if it may be so called consists of a perfectly
level plain studded over as far as the eye can reach with the toldos
or oven-shaped huts of the indians the families of the friendly
indians who were fighting on the side of rosas resided here we met
and passed many young indian women riding by two or three together on
the same horse they as well as many of the young men were strikingly
handsome their fine ruddy complexions being the picture of health 
besides the toldos there were three ranchos one inhabited by the
commandant and the two others by spaniards with small shops 

we were here able to buy some biscuit i had now been several days
without tasting anything besides meat i did not at all dislike this
new regimen but i felt as if it would only have agreed with me with
hard exercise i have heard that patients in england when desired to
confine themselves exclusively to an animal diet even with the hope of
life before their eyes have hardly been able to endure it yet the
gaucho in the pampas for months together touches nothing but beef 
but they eat i observe a very large proportion of fat which is of a
less animalized nature and they particularly dislike dry meat such as
that of the agouti dr richardson also has remarked that when
people have fed for a long time solely upon lean animal food the
desire for fat becomes so insatiable that they can consume a large
quantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea this appears to
me a curious physiological fact it is perhaps from their meat
regimen that the gauchos like other carnivorous animals can abstain
long from food i was told that at tandeel some troops voluntarily
pursued a party of indians for three days without eating or drinking 

we saw in the shops many articles such as horsecloths belts and
garters woven by the indian women the patterns were very pretty and
the colours brilliant the workmanship of the garters was so good that
an english merchant at buenos ayres maintained they must have been
manufactured in england till he found the tassels had been fastened by
split sinew 

september th we had a very long ride this day at the twelfth
posta which is seven leagues south of the rio salado we came to the
first estancia with cattle and white women afterwards we had to ride
for many miles through a country flooded with water above our horses 
knees by crossing the stirrups and riding arab-like with our legs
bent up we contrived to keep tolerably dry it was nearly dark when
we arrived at the salado the stream was deep and about forty yards
wide in summer however its bed becomes almost dry and the little
remaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea we slept at one of
the great estancias of general rosas it was fortified and of such an
extent that arriving in the dark i thought it was a town and fortress 
in the morning we saw immense herds of cattle the general here having
seventy-four square leagues of land formerly nearly three hundred men
were employed about this estate and they defied all the attacks of the
indians 

september th passed the guardia del monte this is a nice
scattered little town with many gardens full of peach and quince
trees the plain here looked like that around buenos ayres the turf
being short and bright green with beds of clover and thistles and
with bizcacha holes i was very much struck with the marked change in
the aspect of the country after having crossed the salado from a
coarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure i at
first attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil but the
inhabitants assured me that here as well as in banda oriental where
there is as great a difference between the country round monte video
and the thinly-inhabited savannahs of colonia the whole was to be
attributed to the manuring and grazing of the cattle exactly the same
fact has been observed in the prairies of north america where
coarse grass between five and six feet high when grazed by cattle 
changes into common pasture land i am not botanist enough to say
whether the change here is owing to the introduction of new species to
the altered growth of the same or to a difference in their
proportional numbers azara has also observed with astonishment this
change he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance of
plants not occurring in the neighbourhood on the borders of any track
that leads to a newly-constructed hovel in another part he says 
 ces chevaux sauvages ont la manie de preferer les chemins et le
bord des routes pour deposer leurs excremens dont on trouve des
monceaux dans ces endroits does this not partly explain the
circumstance we thus have lines of richly manured land serving as
channels of communication across wide districts 

near the guardia we find the southern limit of two european plants now
become extraordinarily common the fennel in great profusion covers
the ditch-banks in the neighbourhood of buenos ayres monte video and
other towns but the cardoon cynara cardunculus has a far wider
range it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the 
cordillera across the continent i saw it in unfrequented spots in
chile entre rios and banda oriental in the latter country alone 
very many probably several hundred square miles are covered by one
mass of these prickly plants and are impenetrable by man or beast 
over the undulating plains where these great beds occur nothing else
can now live before their introduction however the surface must
have supported as in other parts a rank herbage i doubt whether any
case is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over
the aborigines as i have already said i nowhere saw the cardoon
south of the salado but it is probable that in proportion as that
country becomes inhabited the cardoon will extend its limits the
case is different with the giant thistle with variegated leaves of
the pampas for i met with it in the valley of the sauce according to
the principles so well laid down by mr lyell few countries have
undergone more remarkable changes since the year when the first
colonist of la plata landed with seventy-two horses the countless
herds of horses cattle and sheep not only have altered the whole
aspect of the vegetation but they have almost banished the guanaco 
deer and ostrich numberless other changes must likewise have taken
place the wild pig in some parts probably replaces the peccari packs
of wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks of the
less-frequented streams and the common cat altered into a large and
fierce animal inhabits rocky hills as m d orbigny has remarked the
increase in numbers of the carrion-vulture since the introduction of
the domestic animals must have been infinitely great and we have
given reasons for believing that they have extended their southern
range no doubt many plants besides the cardoon and fennel are
naturalized thus the islands near the mouth of the parana are thickly
clothed with peach and orange trees springing from seeds carried there
by the waters of the river 

while changing horses at the guardia several people questioned us much
about the army i never saw anything like the enthusiasm for rosas 
and for the success of the most just of all wars because against
barbarians this expression it must be confessed is very natural 
for till lately neither man woman nor horse was safe from the
attacks of the indians we had a long day s ride over the same rich
green plain abounding with various flocks and with here and there a
solitary estancia and its one ombu tree in the evening it rained
heavily on arriving at a posthouse we were told by the owner that if
we had not a regular passport we must pass on for there were so many
robbers he would trust no one when he read however my passport 
which began with el naturalista don carlos his respect and civility
were as unbounded as his suspicions had been before what a naturalist
might be neither he nor his countrymen i suspect had any idea but
probably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause 

september th we arrived by the middle of the day at buenos ayres 
the outskirts of the city looked quite pretty with the agave hedges 
and groves of olive peach and willow trees all just throwing out
their fresh green leaves i rode to the house of mr lumb an english
merchant to whose kindness and hospitality during my stay in the
country i was greatly indebted 

the city of buenos ayres is large and i should think one of the
most regular in the world every street is at right angles to the one
it crosses and the parallel ones being equidistant the houses are
collected into solid squares of equal dimensions which are called
quadras on the other hand the houses themselves are hollow squares 
all the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard they are generally
only one story high with flat roofs which are fitted with seats and
are much frequented by the inhabitants in summer in the centre of the
town is the plaza where the public offices fortress cathedral etc 
stand here also the old viceroys before the revolution had their
palaces the general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable
architectural beauty although none individually can boast of any 

the great corral where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply
food to this beef-eating population is one of the spectacles best
worth seeing the strength of the horse as compared to that of the
bullock is quite astonishing a man on horseback having thrown his lazo
round the horns of a beast can drag it anywhere he chooses the
animal ploughing up the ground with outstretched legs in vain efforts
to resist the force generally dashes at full speed to one side but
the horse immediately turning to receive the shock stands so firmly
that the bullock is almost thrown down and it is surprising that their
necks are not broken the struggle is not however one of fair
strength the horse s girth being matched against the bullock s
extended neck in a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse 
if caught with the lazo just behind the ears when the bullock has
been dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered the matador
with great caution cuts the hamstrings then is given the death bellow 
a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any i know i have often
distinguished it from a long distance and have always known that the
struggle was then drawing to a close the whole sight is horrible and
revolting the ground is almost made of bones and the horses and
riders are drenched with gore 

 i call these thistle-stalks for the want of a more correct name i
believe it is a species of eryngium

september th in the evening i set out on an excursion to st fe 
which is situated nearly three hundred english miles from buenos ayres 
on the banks of the parana the roads in the neighbourhood of the city
after the rainy weather were extraordinarily bad i should never have
thought it possible for a bullock waggon to have crawled along as it
was they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour and a man was
kept ahead to survey the best line for making the attempt the
bullocks were terribly jaded it is a great mistake to suppose that
with improved roads and an accelerated rate of travelling the
sufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion we passed a
train of waggons and a troop of beasts on their road to mendoza the
distance is about geographical miles and the journey is generally
performed in fifty days these waggons are very long narrow and
thatched with reeds they have only two wheels the diameter of which
in some cases is as much as ten feet each is drawn by six bullocks 
which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long this is
suspended from within the roof for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is
kept and for the intermediate pair a point projects at right angles
from the middle of the long one 

the whole apparatus looked like some implement of war 

september th we passed the small town of luxan where there is a
wooden bridge over the river a most unusual convenience in this
country we passed also areco the plains appeared level but were not
so in fact for in various places the horizon was distant the
estancias are here wide apart for there is little good pasture owing
to the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover or of the
great thistle the latter well known from the animated description
given by sir f head were at this time of the year two-thirds grown 
in some parts they were as high as the horse s back but in others they
had not yet sprung up and the ground was bare and dusty as on a
turnpike-road the clumps were of the most brilliant green and they
made a pleasing miniature-likeness of broken forest land when the
thistles are full grown the great beds are impenetrable except by a
few tracts as intricate as those in a labyrinth these are only known
to the robbers who at this season inhabit them and sally forth at
night to rob and cut throats with impunity upon asking at a house
whether robbers were numerous i was answered the thistles are not up
yet the meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious there
is little interest in passing over these tracts for they are inhabited
by few animals or birds excepting the bizcacha and its friend the
little owl 

the bizcacha is well known to form a prominent feature in the
zoology of the pampas it is found as far south as the rio negro in
lat degs but not beyond it cannot like the agouti subsist on
the gravelly and desert plains of patagonia but prefers a clayey or
sandy soil which produces a different and more abundant vegetation 
near mendoza at the foot of the cordillera it occurs in close
neighbourhood with the allied alpine species it is a very curious
circumstance in its geographical distribution that it has never been
seen fortunately for the inhabitants of banda oriental to the
eastward of the river uruguay yet in this province there are plains
which appear admirably adapted to its habits the uruguay has formed an
insuperable obstacle to its migration although the broader barrier of
the parana has been passed and the bizcacha is common in entre rios 
the province between these two great rivers near buenos ayres these
animals are exceedingly common their most favourite resort appears to
be those parts of the plain which during one-half of the year are
covered with giant thistles to the exclusion of other plants the
gauchos affirm that it lives on roots which from the great strength
of its gnawing teeth and the kind of places frequented by it seems
probable in the evening the bizcachas come out in numbers and quietly
sit at the mouths of their burrows on their haunches at such times
they are very tame and a man on horseback passing by seems only to
present an object for their grave contemplation they run very
awkwardly and when running out of danger from their elevated tails
and short front legs much resemble great rats their flesh when
cooked is very white and good but it is seldom used 

the bizcacha has one very singular habit namely dragging every hard
object to the mouth of its burrow around each group of holes many
bones of cattle stones thistle-stalks hard lumps of earth dry dung 
etc are collected into an irregular heap which frequently amounts to
as much as a wheelbarrow would contain i was credibly informed that a
gentleman when riding on a dark night dropped his watch he returned
in the morning and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha
hole on the line of road as he expected he soon found it this habit
of picking up whatever may be lying on the ground anywhere near its
habitation must cost much trouble for what purpose it is done i am
quite unable to form even the most remote conjecture it cannot be for
defence because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the
burrow which enters the ground at a very small inclination no doubt
there must exist some good reason but the inhabitants of the country
are quite ignorant of it the only fact which i know analogous to it 
is the habit of that extraordinary australian bird the calodera
maculata which makes an elegant vaulted passage of twigs for playing
in and which collects near the spot land and sea-shells bones and
the feathers of birds especially brightly coloured ones mr gould 
who has described these facts informs me that the natives when they
lose any hard object search the playing passages and he has known a
tobacco-pipe thus recovered 

the little owl athene cunicularia which has been so often mentioned 
on the plains of buenos ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the
bizcacha but in banda oriental it is its own workman during the open
day but more especially in the evening these birds may be seen in
every direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their
burrows if disturbed they either enter the hole or uttering a
shrill harsh cry move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short
distance and then turning round steadily gaze at their pursuer 
occasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting i found in the
stomachs of two which i opened the remains of mice and i one day saw a
small snake killed and carried away it is said that snakes are their
common prey during the daytime i may here mention as showing on what
various kinds of food owls subsist that a species killed among the
islets of the chonos archipelago had its stomach full of good-sized
crabs in india there is a fishing genus of owls which likewise
catches crabs 

in the evening we crossed the rio arrecife on a simple raft made of
barrels lashed together and slept at the post-house on the other side 
i this day paid horse-hire for thirty-one leagues and although the sun
was glaring hot i was but little fatigued when captain head talks of
riding fifty leagues a day i do not imagine the distance is equal to
 english miles at all events the thirty-one leagues was only 
miles in a straight line and in an open country i should think four
additional miles for turnings would be a sufficient allowance 

th and th we continued to ride over plains of the same character 
at san nicolas i first saw the noble river of the parana at the foot
of the cliff on which the town stands some large vessels were at
anchor before arriving at rozario we crossed the saladillo a stream
of fine clear running water but too saline to drink rozario is a
large town built on a dead level plain which forms a cliff about sixty
feet high over the parana the river here is very broad with many
islands which are low and wooded as is also the opposite shore the
view would resemble that of a great lake if it were not for the
linear-shaped islets which alone give the idea of running water the
cliffs are the most picturesque part sometimes they are absolutely
perpendicular and of a red colour at other times in large broken
masses covered with cacti and mimosa-trees the real grandeur 
however of an immense river like this is derived from reflecting how
important a means of communication and commerce it forms between one
nation and another to what a distance it travels and from how vast a
territory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your
feet 

for many leagues north and south of san nicolas and rozario the
country is really level scarcely anything which travellers have
written about its extreme flatness can be considered as exaggeration 
yet i could never find a spot where by slowly turning round objects
were not seen at greater distances in some directions than in others 
and this manifestly proves inequality in the plain at sea a person s
eye being six feet above the surface of the water his horizon is two
miles and four-fifths distant in like manner the more level the
plain the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow
limits and this in my opinion entirely destroys that grandeur which
one would have imagined that a vast level plain would have possessed 

october st we started by moonlight and arrived at the rio tercero by
sunrise the river is also called the saladillo and it deserves the
name for the water is brackish i stayed here the greater part of the
day searching for fossil bones besides a perfect tooth of the
toxodon and many scattered bones i found two immense skeletons near
each other projecting in bold relief from the perpendicular cliff of
the parana they were however so completely decayed that i could
only bring away small fragments of one of the great molar teeth but
these are sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a mastodon 
probably to the same species with that which formerly must have
inhabited the cordillera in upper peru in such great numbers the men
who took me in the canoe said they had long known of these skeletons 
and had often wondered how they had got there the necessity of a
theory being felt they came to the conclusion that like the bizcacha 
the mastodon was formerly a burrowing animal in the evening we rode
another stage and crossed the monge another brackish stream bearing
the dregs of the washings of the pampas 

october nd we passed through corunda which from the luxuriance of
its gardens was one of the prettiest villages i saw from this point
to st fe the road is not very safe the western side of the parana
northward ceases to be inhabited and hence the indians sometimes come
down thus far and waylay travellers the nature of the country also
favours this for instead of a grassy plain there is an open woodland 
composed of low prickly mimosas we passed some houses that had been
ransacked and since deserted we saw also a spectacle which my guides
viewed with high satisfaction it was the skeleton of an indian with
the dried skin hanging on the bones suspended to the branch of a tree 

in the morning we arrived at st fe i was surprised to observe how
great a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of
latitude between this place and buenos ayres had caused this was
evident from the dress and complexion of the men from the increased
size of the ombu-trees the number of new cacti and other plants and
especially from the birds in the course of an hour i remarked
half-a-dozen birds which i had never seen at buenos ayres considering
that there is no natural boundary between the two places and that the
character of the country is nearly similar the difference was much
greater than i should have expected 

october rd and th i was confined for these two days to my bed by a
headache a good-natured old woman who attended me wished me to try
many odd remedies a common practice is to bind an orange-leaf or a
bit of black plaster to each temple and a still more general plan is 
to split a bean into halves moisten them and place one on each
temple where they will easily adhere it is not thought proper ever
to remove the beans or plaster but to allow them to drop off and
sometimes if a man with patches on his head is asked what is the
matter he will answer i had a headache the day before yesterday 
many of the remedies used by the people of the country are ludicrously
strange but too disgusting to be mentioned one of the least nasty is
to kill and cut open two puppies and bind them on each side of a broken
limb little hairless dogs are in great request to sleep at the feet
of invalids 

st fe is a quiet little town and is kept clean and in good order the
governor lopez was a common soldier at the time of the revolution 
but has now been seventeen years in power this stability of
government is owing to his tyrannical habits for tyranny seems as yet
better adapted to these countries than republicanism the governor s
favourite occupation is hunting indians a short time since he
slaughtered forty-eight and sold the children at the rate of three or
four pounds apiece 

october th we crossed the parana to st fe bajada a town on the
opposite shore the passage took some hours as the river here
consisted of a labyrinth of small streams separated by low wooded
islands i had a letter of introduction to an old catalonian spaniard 
who treated me with the most uncommon hospitality the bajada is the
capital of entre rios in the town contained inhabitants 
and the province yet few as the inhabitants are no province
has suffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions they boast
here of representatives ministers a standing army and governors so
it is no wonder that they have their revolutions at some future day
this must be one of the richest countries of la plata the soil is
varied and productive and its almost insular form gives it two grand
lines of communication by the rivers parana and uruguay 


i was delayed here five days and employed myself in examining the
geology of the surrounding country which was very interesting we
here see at the bottom of the cliffs beds containing sharks teeth and
sea-shells of extinct species passing above into an indurated marl 
and from that into the red clayey earth of the pampas with its
calcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds this
vertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure salt-water 
gradually encroached on and at last converted into the bed of a muddy
estuary into which floating carcasses were swept at punta gorda in
banda oriental i found an alternation of the pampaean estuary deposit 
with a limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells and
this shows either a change in the former currents or more probably an
oscillation of level in the bottom of the ancient estuary until
lately my reasons for considering the pampaean formation to be an
estuary deposit were its general appearance its position at the mouth
of the existing great river the plata and the presence of so many
bones of terrestrial quadrupeds but now professor ehrenberg has had
the kindness to examine for me a little of the red earth taken from
low down in the deposit close to the skeletons of the mastodon and he
finds in it many infusoria partly salt-water and partly fresh-water
forms with the latter rather preponderating and therefore as he
remarks the water must have been brackish m a d orbigny found on
the banks of the parana at the height of a hundred feet great beds of
an estuary shell now living a hundred miles lower down nearer the sea 
and i found similar shells at a less height on the banks of the
uruguay this shows that just before the pampas was slowly elevated
into dry land the water covering it was brackish below buenos ayres
there are upraised beds of sea-shells of existing species which also
proves that the period of elevation of the pampas was within the recent
period 

in the pampaean deposit at the bajada i found the osseous armour of a
gigantic armadillo-like animal the inside of which when the earth was
removed was like a great cauldron i found also teeth of the toxodon
and mastodon and one tooth of a horse in the same stained and decayed
state this latter tooth greatly interested me and i took
scrupulous care in ascertaining that it had been embedded
contemporaneously with the other remains for i was not then aware that
amongst the fossils from bahia blanca there was a horse s tooth hidden
in the matrix nor was it then known with certainty that the remains of
horses are common in north america mr lyell has lately brought from
the united states a tooth of a horse and it is an interesting fact 
that professor owen could find in no species either fossil or recent 
a slight but peculiar curvature characterizing it until he thought of
comparing it with my specimen found here he has named this american
horse equus curvidens certainly it is a marvellous fact in the
history of the mammalia that in south america a native horse should
have lived and disappeared to be succeeded in after-ages by the
countless herds descended from the few introduced with the spanish
colonists 

the existence in south america of a fossil horse of the mastodon 
possibly of an elephant and of a hollow-horned ruminant 
discovered by mm lund and clausen in the caves of brazil are highly
interesting facts with respect to the geographical distribution of
animals at the present time if we divide america not by the isthmus
of panama but by the southern part of mexico in lat degs 
where the great table-land presents an obstacle to the migration of
species by affecting the climate and by forming with the exception
of some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast a broad
barrier we shall then have the two zoological provinces of north and
south america strongly contrasted with each other some few species
alone have passed the barrier and may be considered as wanderers from
the south such as the puma opossum kinkajou and peccari south
america is characterized by possessing many peculiar gnawers a family
of monkeys the llama peccari tapir opossums and especially 
several genera of edentata the order which includes the sloths 
ant-eaters and armadilloes north america on the other hand is
characterized putting on one side a few wandering species by numerous
peculiar gnawers and by four genera the ox sheep goat and
antelope of hollow-horned ruminants of which great division south
america is not known to possess a single species formerly but within
the period when most of the now existing shells were living north
america possessed besides hollow-horned ruminants the elephant 
mastodon horse and three genera of edentata namely the megatherium 
megalonyx and mylodon within nearly this same period as proved by
the shells at bahia blanca south america possessed as we have just
seen a mastodon horse hollow-horned ruminant and the same three
genera as well as several others of the edentata hence it is
evident that north and south america in having within a late
geological period these several genera in common were much more
closely related in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than
they now are the more i reflect on this case the more interesting it
appears i know of no other instance where we can almost mark the
period and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two
well-characterized zoological provinces the geologist who is fully
impressed with the vast oscillations of level which have affected the
earth s crust within late periods will not fear to speculate on the
recent elevation of the mexican platform or more probably on the
recent submergence of land in the west indian archipelago as the cause
of the present zoological separation of north and south america the
south american character of the west indian mammals seems to
indicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern
continent and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence 

when america and especially north america possessed its elephants 
mastodons horse and hollow-horned ruminants it was much more closely
related in its zoological characters to the temperate parts of europe
and asia than it now is as the remains of these genera are found on
both sides of behring s straits and on the plains of siberia we
are led to look to the north-western side of north america as the
former point of communication between the old and so-called new world 
and as so many species both living and extinct of these same genera
inhabit and have inhabited the old world it seems most probable that
the north american elephants mastodons horse and hollow-horned
ruminants migrated on land since submerged near behring s straits 
from siberia into north america and thence on land since submerged in
the west indies into south america where for a time they mingled with
the forms characteristic of that southern continent and have since
become extinct 


while travelling through the country i received several vivid
descriptions of the effects of a late great drought and the account of
this may throw some light on the cases where vast numbers of animals of
all kinds have been embedded together the period included between the
years and is called the gran seco or the great drought 
during this time so little rain fell that the vegetation even to the
thistles failed the brooks were dried up and the whole country
assumed the appearance of a dusty high road this was especially the
case in the northern part of the province of buenos ayres and the
southern part of st fe very great numbers of birds wild animals 
cattle and horses perished from the want of food and water a man
told me that the deer used to come into his courtyard to the well 
which he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water 
and that the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued 
the lowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of buenos
ayres alone was taken at one million head a proprietor at san pedro
had previously to these years cattle at the end not one
remained san pedro is situated in the middle of the finest country 
and even now abounds again with animals yet during the latter part of
the gran seco live cattle were brought in vessels for the
consumption of the inhabitants the animals roamed from their
estancias and wandering far southward were mingled together in such
multitudes that a government commission was sent from buenos ayres to
settle the disputes of the owners sir woodbine parish informed me of
another and very curious source of dispute the ground being so long
dry such quantities of dust were blown about that in this open
country the landmarks became obliterated and people could not tell the
limits of their estates 

i was informed by an eye-witness that the cattle in herds of thousands
rushed into the parana and being exhausted by hunger they were unable
to crawl up the muddy banks and thus were drowned the arm of the
river which runs by san pedro was so full of putrid carcasses that the
master of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impassable 
without doubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the
river their bodies when putrid were seen floating down the stream and
many in all probability were deposited in the estuary of the plata all
the small rivers became highly saline and this caused the death of
vast numbers in particular spots for when an animal drinks of such
water it does not recover azara describes the fury of the wild
horses on a similar occasion rushing into the marshes those which
arrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by those which followed he
adds that more than once he has seen the carcasses of upwards of a
thousand wild horses thus destroyed i noticed that the smaller
streams in the pampas were paved with a breccia of bones but this
probably is the effect of a gradual increase rather than of the
destruction at any one period subsequently to the drought of to
 a very rainy season followed which caused great floods hence it
is almost certain that some thousands of the skeletons were buried by
the deposits of the very next year what would be the opinion of a
geologist viewing such an enormous collection of bones of all kinds
of animals and of all ages thus embedded in one thick earthy mass 
would he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the surface of
the land rather than to the common order of things 

october th i had intended to push my excursion further but not
being quite well i was compelled to return by a balandra or
one-masted vessel of about a hundred tons burden which was bound to
buenos ayres as the weather was not fair we moored early in the day
to a branch of a tree on one of the islands the parana is full of
islands which undergo a constant round of decay and renovation in the
memory of the master several large ones had disappeared and others
again had been formed and protected by vegetation they are composed
of muddy sand without even the smallest pebble and were then about
four feet above the level of the river but during the periodical
floods they are inundated they all present one character numerous
willows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of
creeping plants thus forming a thick jungle these thickets afford a
retreat for capybaras and jaguars the fear of the latter animal quite
destroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods this evening i
had not proceeded a hundred yards before finding indubitable signs of
the recent presence of the tiger i was obliged to come back on every
island there were tracks and as on the former excursion el rastro de
los indios had been the subject of conversation so in this was el
rastro del tigre the wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be
the favourite haunts of the jaguar but south of the plata i was told
that they frequented the reeds bordering lakes wherever they are they
seem to require water their common prey is the capybara so that it
is generally said where capybaras are numerous there is little danger
from the jaguar falconer states that near the southern side of the
mouth of the plata there are many jaguars and that they chiefly live
on fish this account i have heard repeated on the parana they have
killed many wood-cutters and have even entered vessels at night there
is a man now living in the bajada who coming up from below when it
was dark was seized on the deck he escaped however with the loss of
the use of one arm when the floods drive these animals from the
islands they are most dangerous i was told that a few years since a
very large one found its way into a church at st fe two padres
entering one after the other were killed and a third who came to see
what was the matter escaped with difficulty the beast was destroyed
by being shot from a corner of the building which was unroofed they
commit also at these times great ravages among cattle and horses it
is said that they kill their prey by breaking their necks if driven
from the carcass they seldom return to it the gauchos say that the
jaguar when wandering about at night is much tormented by the foxes
yelping as they follow him this is a curious coincidence with the
fact which is generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying in a
similarly officious manner the east indian tiger the jaguar is a
noisy animal roaring much by night and especially before bad weather 

one day when hunting on the banks of the uruguay i was shown certain
trees to which these animals constantly recur for the purpose as it
is said of sharpening their claws i saw three well-known trees in
front the bark was worn smooth as if by the breast of the animal and
on each side there were deep scratches or rather grooves extending in
an oblique line nearly a yard in length the scars were of different
ages a common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the
neighbourhood is to examine these trees i imagine this habit of the
jaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the
common cat as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it scrapes the
leg of a chair and i have heard of young fruit-trees in an orchard in
england having been thus much injured some such habit must also be
common to the puma for on the bare hard soil of patagonia i have
frequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made
them the object of this practice is i believe to tear off the
ragged points of their claws and not as the gauchos think to sharpen
them the jaguar is killed without much difficulty by the aid of
dogs baying and driving him up a tree where he is despatched with
bullets 

owing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings our only
amusement was catching fish for our dinner there were several kinds 
and all good eating a fish called the armado a silurus is
remarkable from a harsh grating noise which it makes when caught by
hook and line and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is
beneath the water this same fish has the power of firmly catching
hold of any object such as the blade of an oar or the fishing-line 
with the strong spine both of its pectoral and dorsal fin in the
evening the weather was quite tropical the thermometer standing at 
degs numbers of fireflies were hovering about and the musquitoes
were very troublesome i exposed my hand for five minutes and it was
soon black with them i do not suppose there could have been less than
fifty all busy sucking 

october th we got under way and passed punta gorda where there is
a colony of tame indians from the province of missiones we sailed
rapidly down the current but before sunset from a silly fear of bad
weather we brought-to in a narrow arm of the river i took the boat
and rowed some distance up this creek it was very narrow winding 
and deep on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high formed by
trees intwined with creepers gave to the canal a singularly gloomy
appearance i here saw a very extraordinary bird called the
scissor-beak rhynchops nigra it has short legs web feet extremely
long-pointed wings and is of about the size of a tern the beak is
flattened laterally that is in a plane at right angles to that of a
spoonbill or duck it is as flat and elastic as an ivory paper-cutter 
and the lower mandible differing from every other bird is an inch and
a half longer than the upper in a lake near maldonado from which the
water had been nearly drained and which in consequence swarmed with
small fry i saw several of these birds generally in small flocks 
flying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake 
they kept their bills wide open and the lower mandible half buried in
the water thus skimming the surface they ploughed it in their
course the water was quite smooth and it formed a most curious
spectacle to behold a flock each bird leaving its narrow wake on the
mirror-like surface in their flight they frequently twist about with
extreme quickness and dexterously manage with their projecting lower
mandible to plough up small fish which are secured by the upper and
shorter half of their scissor-like

 picture 

bills this fact i repeatedly saw as like swallows they continued
to fly backwards and forwards close before me occasionally when
leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild irregular and
rapid they then uttered loud harsh cries when these birds are
fishing the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings in
keeping them dry is very evident when thus employed their forms
resemble the symbol by which many artists represent marine birds their
tails are much used in steering their irregular course 

these birds are common far inland along the course of the rio parana 
it is said that they remain here during the whole year and breed in
the marshes during the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains
at some distance from the water being at anchor as i have said in
one of the deep creeks between the islands of the parana as the
evening drew to a close one of these scissor-beaks suddenly appeared 
the water was quite still and many little fish were rising the bird
continued for a long time to skim the surface flying in its wild and
irregular manner up and down the narrow canal now dark with the
growing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees at monte
video i observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the
mud-banks at the head of the harbour in the same manner as on the
grassy plains near the parana and every evening they took flight
seaward from these facts i suspect that the rhynchops generally
fishes by night at which time many of the lower animals come most
abundantly to the surface m lesson states that he has seen these
birds opening the shells of the mactrae buried in the sand-banks on the
coast of chile from their weak bills with the lower mandible so much
projecting their short legs and long wings it is very improbable that
this can be a general habit 

in our course down the parana i observed only three other birds whose
habits are worth mentioning one is a small kingfisher ceryle
americana it has a longer tail than the european species and hence
does not sit in so stiff and upright a position its flight also 
instead of being direct and rapid like the course of an arrow is weak
and undulatory as among the soft-billed birds it utters a low note 
like the clicking together of two small stones a small green parrot
 conurus murinus with a grey breast appears to prefer the tall trees
on the islands to any other situation for its building-place a number
of nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of
sticks these parrots always live in flocks and commit great ravages
on the corn-fields i was told that near colonia were killed in
the course of one year a bird with a forked tail terminated by two
long feathers tyrannus savana and named by the spaniards
scissor-tail is very common near buenos ayres it commonly sits on a
branch of the ombu tree near a house and thence takes a short
flight in pursuit of insects and returns to the same spot when on
the wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a
caricature-likeness of the common swallow it has the power of turning
very shortly in the air and in so doing opens and shuts its tail 
sometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical
direction just like a pair of scissors 

october th some leagues below rozario the western shore of the
parana is bounded by perpendicular cliffs which extend in a long line
to below san nicolas hence it more resembles a sea-coast than that of
a fresh-water river it is a great drawback to the scenery of the
parana that from the soft nature of its banks the water is very
muddy the uruguay flowing through a granitic country is much
clearer and where the two channels unite at the head of the plata the
waters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red
colours in the evening the wind being not quite fair as usual we
immediately moored and the next day as it blew rather freshly though
with a favouring current the master was much too indolent to think of
starting at bajada he was described to me as hombre muy aflicto a
man always miserable to get on but certainly he bore all delays with
admirable resignation he was an old spaniard and had been many years
in this country he professed a great liking to the english but
stoutly maintained that the battle of trafalgar was merely won by the
spanish captains having been all bought over and that the only really
gallant action on either side was performed by the spanish admiral it
struck me as rather characteristic that this man should prefer his
countrymen being thought the worst of traitors rather than unskilful
or cowardly 

th and th we continued slowly to sail down the noble stream the
current helped us but little we met during our descent very few
vessels one of the best gifts of nature in so grand a channel of
communication seems here wilfully thrown away a river in which ships
might navigate from a temperate country as surprisingly abundant in
certain productions as destitute of others to another possessing a
tropical climate and a soil which according to the best of judges m 
bonpland is perhaps unequalled in fertility in any part of the world 
how different would have been the aspect of this river if english
colonists had by good fortune first sailed up the plata what noble
towns would now have occupied its shores till the death of francia 
the dictator of paraguay these two countries must remain distinct as
if placed on opposite sides of the globe and when the old
bloody-minded tyrant is gone to his long account paraguay will be torn
by revolutions violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm 
that country will have to learn like every other south american state 
that a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men
imbued with the principles of justice and honour 

october th being arrived at the mouth of the parana and as i was
very anxious to reach buenos ayres i went on shore at las conchas 
with the intention of riding there upon landing i found to my great
surprise that i was to a certain degree a prisoner a violent
revolution having broken out all the ports were laid under an embargo 
i could not return to my vessel and as for going by land to the city 
it was out of the question after a long conversation with the
commandant i obtained permission to go the next day to general rolor 
who commanded a division of the rebels on this side the capital in
the morning i rode to the encampment the general officers and
soldiers all appeared and i believe really were great villains the
general the very evening before he left the city voluntarily went to
the governor and with his hand to his heart pledged his word of
honour that he at least would remain faithful to the last the general
told me that the city was in a state of close blockade and that all he
could do was to give me a passport to the commander-in-chief of the
rebels at quilmes we had therefore to take a great sweep round the
city and it was with much difficulty that we procured horses my
reception at the encampment was quite civil but i was told it was
impossible that i could be allowed to enter the city i was very
anxious about this as i anticipated the beagle s departure from the
rio plata earlier than it took place having mentioned however 
general rosas s obliging kindness to me when at the colorado magic
itself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this
conversation i was instantly told that though they could not give me
a passport if i chose to leave my guide and horses i might pass their
sentinels i was too glad to accept of this and an officer was sent
with me to give directions that i should not be stopped at the bridge 
the road for the space of a league was quite deserted i met one party
of soldiers who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport 
and at length i was not a little pleased to find myself within the city 

this revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances 
but in a state which in the course of nine months from february to
october underwent fifteen changes in its government each
governor according to the constitution being elected for three
years it would be very unreasonable to ask for pretexts in this
case a party of men who being attached to rosas were disgusted with
the governor balcarce to the number of seventy left the city and with
the cry of rosas the whole country took arms the city was then
blockaded no provisions cattle or horses were allowed to enter 
besides this there was only a little skirmishing and a few men daily
killed the outside party well knew that by stopping the supply of
meat they would certainly be victorious general rosas could not have
known of this rising but it appears to be quite consonant with the
plans of his party a year ago he was elected governor but he refused
it unless the sala would also confer on him extraordinary powers this
was refused and since then his party have shown that no other governor
can keep his place the warfare on both sides was avowedly protracted
till it was possible to hear from rosas a note arrived a few days
after i left buenos ayres which stated that the general disapproved of
peace having been broken but that he thought the outside party had
justice on their side on the bare reception of this the governor 
ministers and part of the military to the number of some hundreds 
fled from the city the rebels entered elected a new governor and
were paid for their services to the number of men from these
proceedings it was clear that rosas ultimately would become the
dictator to the term king the people in this as in other republics 
have a particular dislike since leaving south america we have heard
that rosas has been elected with powers and for a time altogether
opposed to the constitutional principles of the republic 

 the bizcacha lagostomus trichodactylus somewhat resembles a large
rabbit but with bigger gnawing teeth and a long tail it has however 
only three toes behind like the agouti during the last three or four
years the skins of these animals have been sent to england for the sake
of the fur

having been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city i was glad to
escape on board a packet bound for monte video a town in a state of
blockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence in this case
moreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within the
sentinels were the worst of all for from their office and from having
arms in their hands they robbed with a degree of authority which other
men could not imitate 

our passage was a very long and tedious one the plata looks like a
noble estuary on the map but is in truth a poor affair a wide
expanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty at one time of
the day the two shores both of which are extremely low could just be
distinguished from the deck on arriving at monte video i found that
the beagle would not sail for some time so i prepared for a short
excursion in this part of banda oriental everything which i have said
about the country near maldonado is applicable to monte video but the
land with the one exception of the green mount feet high from
which it takes its name is far more level very little of the
undulating grassy plain is enclosed but near the town there are a few
hedge-banks covered with agaves cacti and fennel 

november th we left monte video in the afternoon i intended to
proceed to colonia del sacramiento situated on the northern bank of
the plata and opposite to buenos ayres and thence following up the
uruguay to the village of mercedes on the rio negro one of the many
rivers of this name in south america and from this point to return
direct to monte video we slept at the house of my guide at canelones 
in the morning we rose early in the hopes of being able to ride a good
distance but it was a vain attempt for all the rivers were flooded 
we passed in boats the streams of canelones st lucia and san jose 
and thus lost much time on a former excursion i crossed the lucia
near its mouth and i was surprised to observe how easily our horses 
although not used to swim passed over a width of at least six hundred
yards on mentioning this at monte video i was told that a vessel
containing some mountebanks and their horses being wrecked in the
plata one horse swam seven miles to the shore in the course of the
day i was amused by the dexterity with which a gaucho forced a restive
horse to swim a river he stripped off his clothes and jumping on its
back rode into the water till it was out of its depth then slipping
off over the crupper he caught hold of the tail and as often as the
horse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its
face as soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side the
man pulled himself on and was firmly seated bridle in hand before
the horse gained the bank a naked man on a naked horse is a fine
spectacle i had no idea how well the two animals suited each other 
the tail of a horse is a very useful appendage i have passed a river
in a boat with four people in it which was ferried across in the same
way as the gaucho if a man and horse have to cross a broad river the
best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or mane and help
himself with the other arm 

we slept and stayed the following day at the post of cufre in the
evening the postman or letter-carrier arrived he was a day after his
time owing to the rio rozario being flooded it would not however 
be of much consequence for although he had passed through some of the
principal towns in banda oriental his luggage consisted of two
letters the view from the house was pleasing an undulating green
surface with distant glimpses of the plata i find that i look at
this province with very different eyes from what i did upon my first
arrival i recollect i then thought it singularly level but now 
after galloping over the pampas my only surprise is what could have
induced me ever to call it level the country is a series of
undulations in themselves perhaps not absolutely great but as
compared to the plains of st fe real mountains from these
inequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets and the turf is
green and luxuriant 

november th we crossed the rozario which was deep and rapid and
passing the village of colla arrived at midday at colonia del
sacramiento the distance is twenty leagues through a country covered
with fine grass but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants i was
invited to sleep at colonia and to accompany on the following day a
gentleman to his estancia where there were some limestone rocks the
town is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at
monte video it is strongly fortified but both fortifications and
town suffered much in the brazilian war it is very ancient and the
irregularity of the streets and the surrounding groves of old orange
and peach trees gave it a pretty appearance the church is a curious
ruin it was used as a powder-magazine and was struck by lightning in
one of the ten thousand thunderstorms of the rio plata two-thirds of
the building were blown away to the very foundation and the rest
stands a shattered and curious monument of the united powers of
lightning and gunpowder in the evening i wandered about the
half-demolished walls of the town it was the chief seat of the
brazilian war a war most injurious to this country not so much in
its immediate effects as in being the origin of a multitude of
generals and all other grades of officers more generals are numbered
 but not paid in the united provinces of la plata than in the united
kingdom of great britain these gentlemen have learned to like power 
and do not object to a little skirmishing hence there are many always
on the watch to create disturbance and to overturn a government which
as yet has never rested on any staple foundation i noticed however 
both here and in other places a very general interest in the ensuing
election for the president and this appears a good sign for the
prosperity of this little country the inhabitants do not require much
education in their representatives i heard some men discussing the
merits of those for colonia and it was said that although they were
not men of business they could all sign their names with this they
seemed to think every reasonable man ought to be satisfied 

th rode with my host to his estancia at the arroyo de san juan in
the evening we took a ride round the estate it contained two square
leagues and a half and was situated in what is called a rincon that
is one side was fronted by the plata and the two others guarded by
impassable brooks there was an excellent port for little vessels and
an abundance of small wood which is valuable as supplying fuel to
buenos ayres i was curious to know the value of so complete an
estancia of cattle there were and it would well support three
or four times that number of mares together with broken-in
horses and sheep there was plenty of water and limestone a
rough house excellent corrals and a peach orchard for all this he
had been offered pounds and he only wanted pounds additional 
and probably would sell it for less the chief trouble with an
estancia is driving the cattle twice a week to a central spot in order
to make them tame and to count them this latter operation would be
thought difficult where there are ten or fifteen thousand head
together it is managed on the principle that the cattle invariably
divide themselves into little troops of from forty to one hundred each
troop is recognized by a few peculiarly marked animals and its number
is known so that one being lost out of ten thousand it is perceived
by its absence from one of the tropillas during a stormy night the
cattle all mingle together but the next morning the tropillas separate
as before so that each animal must know its fellow out of ten thousand
others 

on two occasions i met with in this province some oxen of a very
curious breed called nata or niata they appear externally to hold
nearly the same relation to other cattle which bull or pug dogs do to
other dogs their forehead is very short and broad with the nasal end
turned up and the upper lip much drawn back their lower jaws project
beyond the upper and have a corresponding upward curve hence their
teeth are always exposed their nostrils are seated high up and are
very open their eyes project outwards when walking they carry their
heads low on a short neck and their hinder legs are rather longer
compared with the front legs than is usual their bare teeth their
short heads and upturned nostrils give them the most ludicrous
self-confident air of defiance imaginable 

since my return i have procured a skeleton head through the kindness
of my friend captain sulivan r n which is now deposited in the
college of surgeons don f muniz of luxan has kindly collected
for me all the information which he could respecting this breed from
his account it seems that about eighty or ninety years ago they were
rare and kept as curiosities at buenos ayres the breed is universally
believed to have originated amongst the indians southward of the plata 
and that it was with them the commonest kind even to this day those
reared in the provinces near the plata show their less civilized
origin in being fiercer than common cattle and in the cow easily
deserting her first calf if visited too often or molested it is a
singular fact that an almost similar structure to the abnormal one
of the niata breed characterizes as i am informed by dr falconer 
that great extinct ruminant of india the sivatherium the breed is
very true and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves 
a niata bull with a common cow or the reverse cross produces
offspring having an intermediate character but with the niata
characters strongly displayed according to senor muniz there is the
clearest evidence contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in
analogous cases that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull
transmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when
crossed with a common cow when the pasture is tolerably long the
niata cattle feed with the tongue and palate as well as common cattle 
but during the great droughts when so many animals perish the niata
breed is under a great disadvantage and would be exterminated if not
attended to for the common cattle like horses are able just to keep
alive by browsing with their lips on twigs of trees and reeds this
the niatas cannot so well do as their lips do not join and hence they
are found to perish before the common cattle this strikes me as a
good illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary
habits of life on what circumstances occurring only at long
intervals the rarity or extinction of a species may be determined 

november th passing the valley of las vacas we slept at a house of
a north american who worked a lime-kiln on the arroyo de las vivoras 
in the morning we rode to a protecting headland on the banks of the
river called punta gorda on the way we tried to find a jaguar there
were plenty of fresh tracks and we visited the trees on which they
are said to sharpen their claws but we did not succeed in disturbing
one from this point the rio uruguay presented to our view a noble
volume of water from the clearness and rapidity of the stream its
appearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the parana on
the opposite coast several branches from the latter river entered the
uruguay as the sun was shining the two colours of the waters could
be seen quite distinct 

in the evening we proceeded on our road towards mercedes on the rio
negro at night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which
we happened to arrive it was a very large estate being ten leagues
square and the owner is one of the greatest landowners in the country 
his nephew had charge of it and with him there was a captain in the
army who the other day ran away from buenos ayres considering their
station their conversation was rather amusing they expressed as was
usual unbounded astonishment at the globe being round and could
scarcely credit that a hole would if deep enough come out on the
other side they had however heard of a country where there were six
months of light and six of darkness and where the inhabitants were
very tall and thin they were curious about the price and condition of
horses and cattle in england upon finding out we did not catch our
animals with the lazo they cried out ah then you use nothing but
the bolas the idea of an enclosed country was quite new to them the
captain at last said he had one question to ask me which he should be
very much obliged if i would answer with all truth i trembled to
think how deeply scientific it would be it was whether the ladies of
buenos ayres were not the handsomest in the world i replied like a
renegade charmingly so he added i have one other question do
ladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs i
solemnly assured him that they did not they were absolutely
delighted the captain exclaimed look there a man who has seen half
the world says it is the case we always thought so but now we know
it my excellent judgment in combs and beauty procured me a most
hospitable reception the captain forced me to take his bed and he
would sleep on his recado 

st started at sunrise and rode slowly during the whole day the
geological nature of this part of the province was different from the
rest and closely resembled that of the pampas in consequence there
were immense beds of the thistle as well as of the cardoon the whole
country indeed may be called one great bed of these plants the two
sorts grow separate each plant in company with its own kind the
cardoon is as high as a horse s back but the pampas thistle is often
higher than the crown of the rider s head to leave the road for a
yard is out of the question and the road itself is partly and in some
cases entirely closed pasture of course there is none if cattle or
horses once enter the bed they are for the time completely lost hence
it is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the
year for when jaded enough to face the thistles they rush among them 
and are seen no more in these districts there are very few estancias 
and these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp valleys where
fortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can exist as night
came on before we arrived at our journey s end we slept at a miserable
little hovel inhabited by the poorest people the extreme though
rather formal courtesy of our host and hostess considering their grade
of life was quite delightful 

november nd arrived at an estancia on the berquelo belonging to a
very hospitable englishman to whom i had a letter of introduction from
my friend mr lumb i stayed here three days one morning i rode with
my host to the sierra del pedro flaco about twenty miles up the rio
negro nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse
grass which was as high as a horse s belly yet there were square
leagues without a single head of cattle the province of banda
oriental if well stocked would support an astonishing number of
animals at present the annual export of hides from monte video amounts
to three hundred thousand and the home consumption from waste is
very considerable an estanciero told me that he often had to send
large herds of cattle a long journey to a salting establishment and
that the tired beasts were frequently obliged to be killed and skinned 
but that he could never persuade the gauchos to eat of them and every
evening a fresh beast was slaughtered for their suppers the view of
the rio negro from the sierra was more picturesque than any other which
i saw in this province the river broad deep and rapid wound at
the foot of a rocky precipitous cliff a belt of wood followed its
course and the horizon terminated in the distant undulations of the
turf-plain 

when in this neighbourhood i several times heard of the sierra de las
cuentas a hill distant many miles to the northward the name
signifies hill of beads i was assured that vast numbers of little
round stones of various colours each with a small cylindrical hole 
are found there formerly the indians used to collect them for the
purpose of making necklaces and bracelets a taste i may observe 
which is common to all savage nations as well as to the most polished 
i did not know what to understand from this story but upon mentioning
it at the cape of good hope to dr andrew smith he told me that he
recollected finding on the south-eastern coast of africa about one
hundred miles to the eastward of st john s river some quartz
crystals with their edges blunted from attrition and mixed with gravel
on the sea-beach each crystal was about five lines in diameter and
from an inch to an inch and a half in length many of them had a small
canal extending from one extremity to the other perfectly cylindrical 
and of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine
catgut their colour was red or dull white the natives were
acquainted with this structure in crystals i have mentioned these
circumstances because although no crystallized body is at present
known to assume this form it may lead some future traveller to
investigate the real nature of such stones 


while staying at this estancia i was amused with what i saw and heard
of the shepherd-dogs of the country when riding it is a common
thing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs at the
distance of some miles from any house or man i often wondered how so
firm a friendship had been established the method of education
consists in separating the puppy while very young from the bitch and
in accustoming it to its future companions an ewe is held three or
four times a day for the little thing to suck and a nest of wool is
made for it in the sheep-pen at no time is it allowed to associate
with other dogs or with the children of the family the puppy is 
moreover generally castrated so that when grown up it can scarcely
have any feelings in common with the rest of its kind from this
education it has no wish to leave the flock and just as another dog
will defend its master man so will these the sheep it is amusing to
observe when approaching a flock how the dog immediately advances
barking and the sheep all close in his rear as if round the oldest
ram these dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock at a
certain hour in the evening their most troublesome fault when young 
is their desire of playing with the sheep for in their sport they
sometimes gallop their poor subjects most unmercifully 

the shepherd-dog comes to the house every day for some meat and as
soon as it is given him he skulks away as if ashamed of himself on
these occasions the house-dogs are very tyrannical and the least of
them will attack and pursue the stranger the minute however the
latter has reached the flock he turns round and begins to bark and
then all the house-dogs take very quickly to their heels in a similar
manner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs will scarcely ever and i
was told by some never venture to attack a flock guarded by even one
of these faithful shepherds the whole account appears to me a curious
instance of the pliability of the affections in the dog and yet 
whether wild or however educated he has a feeling of respect or fear
for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association for we
can understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by the
single one with its flock except that they consider from some
confused notion that the one thus associated gains power as if in
company with its own kind f cuvier has observed that all animals that
readily enter into domestication consider man as a member of their own
society and thus fulfil their instinct of association in the above
case the shepherd-dog ranks the sheep as its fellow-brethren and thus
gains confidence and the wild dogs though knowing that the individual
sheep are not dogs but are good to eat yet partly consent to this
view when seeing them in a flock with a shepherd-dog at their head 

one evening a domidor a subduer of horses came for the purpose of
breaking-in some colts i will describe the preparatory steps for i
believe they have not been mentioned by other travellers a troop of
wild young horses is driven into the corral or large enclosure of
stakes and the door is shut we will suppose that one man alone has
to catch and mount a horse which as yet had never felt bridle or
saddle i conceive except by a gaucho such a feat would be utterly
impracticable the gaucho picks out a full-grown colt and as the
beast rushes round the circus he throws his lazo so as to catch both
the front legs instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock and
whilst struggling on the ground the gaucho holding the lazo tight 
makes a circle so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the
fetlock and draws it close to the two front legs he then hitches the
lazo so that the three are bound together then sitting on the
horse s neck he fixes a strong bridle without a bit to the lower
jaw this he does by passing a narrow thong through the eye-holes at
the end of the reins and several times round both jaw and tongue the
two front legs are now tied closely together with a strong leathern
thong fastened by a slip-knot the lazo which bound the three
together being then loosed the horse rises with difficulty the
gaucho now holding fast the bridle fixed to the lower jaw leads the
horse outside the corral if a second man is present otherwise the
trouble is much greater he holds the animal s head whilst the first
puts on the horsecloths and saddle and girths the whole together 
during this operation the horse from dread and astonishment at thus
being bound round the waist throws himself over and over again on the
ground and till beaten is unwilling to rise at last when the
saddling is finished the poor animal can hardly breathe from fear and
is white with foam and sweat the man now prepares to mount by
pressing heavily on the stirrup so that the horse may not lose its
balance and at the moment that he throws his leg over the animal s
back he pulls the slip-knot binding the front legs and the beast is
free some domidors pull the knot while the animal is lying on the
ground and standing over the saddle allow him to rise beneath them 
the horse wild with dread gives a few most violent bounds and then
starts off at full gallop when quite exhausted the man by patience 
brings him back to the corral where reeking hot and scarcely alive 
the poor beast is let free those animals which will not gallop away 
but obstinately throw themselves on the ground are by far the most
troublesome this process is tremendously severe but in two or three
trials the horse is tamed it is not however for some weeks that the
animal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring for it must learn to
associate the will of its rider with the feel of the rein before the
most powerful bridle can be of any service 

animals are so abundant in these countries that humanity and
self-interest are not closely united therefore i fear it is that the
former is here scarcely known one day riding in the pampas with a
very respectable estanciero my horse being tired lagged behind 
the man often shouted to me to spur him when i remonstrated that it
was a pity for the horse was quite exhausted he cried out why
not never mind spur him it is my horse i had then some difficulty
in making him comprehend that it was for the horse s sake and not on
his account that i did not choose to use my spurs he exclaimed with
a look of great surprise ah don carlos que cosa it was clear that
such an idea had never before entered his head 

the gauchos are well known to be perfect riders the idea of being
thrown let the horse do what it likes never enters their head their
criterion of a good rider is a man who can manage an untamed colt or
who if his horse falls alights on his own feet or can perform other
such exploits i have heard of a man betting that he would throw his
horse down twenty times and that nineteen times he would not fall
himself i recollect seeing a gaucho riding a very stubborn horse 
which three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with
great violence the man judged with uncommon coolness the proper
moment for slipping off not an instant before or after the right time 
and as soon as the horse got up the man jumped on his back and at
last they started at a gallop the gaucho never appears to exert any
muscular force i was one day watching a good rider as we were
galloping along at a rapid pace and thought to myself surely if the
horse starts you appear so careless on your seat you must fall at
this moment a male ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the
horse s nose the young colt bounded on one side like a stag but as
for the man all that could be said was that he started and took
fright with his horse 

in chile and peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than
in la plata and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate
nature of the country in chile a horse is not considered perfectly
broken till he can be brought up standing in the midst of his full
speed on any particular spot for instance on a cloak thrown on the
ground or again he will charge a wall and rearing scrape the
surface with his hoofs i have seen an animal bounding with spirit 
yet merely reined by a fore-finger and thumb taken at full gallop
across a courtyard and then made to wheel round the post of a veranda
with great speed but at so equal a distance that the rider with
outstretched arm all the while kept one finger rubbing the post then
making a demi-volte in the air with the other arm outstretched in a
like manner he wheeled round with astonishing force in an opposite
direction 

such a horse is well broken and although this at first may appear
useless it is far otherwise it is only carrying that which is daily
necessary into perfection when a bullock is checked and caught by the
lazo it will sometimes gallop round and round in a circle and the
horse being alarmed at the great strain if not well broken will not
readily turn like the pivot of a wheel in consequence many men have
been killed for if the lazo once takes a twist round a man s body it
will instantly from the power of the two opposed animals almost cut
him in twain on the same principle the races are managed the course
is only two or three hundred yards long the wish being to have horses
that can make a rapid dash the race-horses are trained not only to
stand with their hoofs touching a line but to draw all four feet
together so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action
of the hind-quarters in chile i was told an anecdote which i believe
was true and it offers a good illustration of the use of a well-broken
animal a respectable man riding one day met two others one of whom
was mounted on a horse which he knew to have been stolen from himself 
he challenged them they answered him by drawing their sabres and
giving chase the man on his good and fleet beast kept just ahead 
as he passed a thick bush he wheeled round it and brought up his horse
to a dead check the pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and
ahead then instantly dashing on right behind them he buried his
knife in the back of one wounded the other recovered his horse from
the dying robber and rode home for these feats of horsemanship two
things are necessary a most severe bit like the mameluke the power
of which though seldom used the horse knows full well and large
blunt spurs that can be applied either as a mere touch or as an
instrument of extreme pain i conceive that with english spurs the
slightest touch of which pricks the skin it would be impossible to
break in a horse after the south american fashion 

at an estancia near las vacas large numbers of mares are weekly
slaughtered for the sake of their hides although worth only five paper
dollars or about half a crown apiece it seems at first strange that
it can answer to kill mares for such a trifle but as it is thought
ridiculous in this country ever to break in or ride a mare they are of
no value except for breeding the only thing for which i ever saw
mares used was to tread out wheat from the ear for which purpose they
were driven round a circular enclosure where the wheat-sheaves were
strewed the man employed for slaughtering the mares happened to be
celebrated for his dexterity with the lazo standing at the distance
of twelve yards from the mouth of the corral he has laid a wager that
he would catch by the legs every animal without missing one as it
rushed past him there was another man who said he would enter the
corral on foot catch a mare fasten her front legs together drive her
out throw her down kill skin and stake the hide for drying which
latter is a tedious job and he engaged that he would perform this
whole operation on twenty-two animals in one day or he would kill and
take the skin off fifty in the same time this would have been a
prodigious task for it is considered a good day s work to skin and
stake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals 

november th i set out on my return in a direct line for monte
video having heard of some giant s bones at a neighbouring farm-house
on the sarandis a small stream entering the rio negro i rode there
accompanied by my host and purchased for the value of eighteen pence
the head of the toxodon when found it was quite perfect but the
boys knocked out some of the teeth with stones and then set up the
head as a mark to throw at by a most fortunate chance i found a
perfect tooth which exactly fitted one of the sockets in this skull 
embedded by itself on the banks of the rio tercero at the distance of
about miles from this place i found remains of this extraordinary
animal at two other places so that it must formerly have been common 
i found here also some large portions of the armour of a gigantic
armadillo-like animal and part of the great head of a mylodon the
bones of this head are so fresh that they contain according to the
analysis by mr t reeks seven per cent of animal matter and when
placed in a spirit-lamp they burn with a small flame the number of
the remains embedded in the grand estuary deposit which forms the
pampas and covers the granitic rocks of banda oriental must be
extraordinarily great i believe a straight line drawn in any
direction through the pampas would cut through some skeleton or bones 
besides those which i found during my short excursions i heard of many
others and the origin of such names as the stream of the animal 
 the hill of the giant is obvious at other times i heard of the
marvellous property of certain rivers which had the power of changing
small bones into large or as some maintained the bones themselves
grew as far as i am aware not one of these animals perished as was
formerly supposed in the marshes or muddy river-beds of the present
land but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the
subaqueous deposit in which they were originally embedded we may
conclude that the whole area of the pampas is one wide sepulchre of
these extinct gigantic quadrupeds 

by the middle of the day on the th we arrived at monte video 
having been two days and a half on the road the country for the whole
way was of a very uniform character some parts being rather more rocky
and hilly than near the plata not far from monte video we passed
through the village of las pietras so named from some large rounded
masses of syenite its appearance was rather pretty in this country
a few fig-trees round a group of houses and a site elevated a hundred
feet above the general level ought always to be called picturesque 


during the last six months i have had an opportunity of seeing a little
of the character of the inhabitants of these provinces the gauchos 
or countryrmen are very superior to those who reside in the towns the
gaucho is invariably most obliging polite and hospitable i did not
meet with even one instance of rudeness or inhospitality he is
modest both respecting himself and country but at the same time a
spirited bold fellow on the other hand many robberies are
committed and there is much bloodshed the habit of constantly wearing
the knife is the chief cause of the latter it is lamentable to hear
how many lives are lost in trifling quarrels in fighting each party
tries to mark the face of his adversary by slashing his nose or eyes 
as is often attested by deep and horrid-looking scars robberies are a
natural consequence of universal gambling much drinking and extreme
indolence at mercedes i asked two men why they did not work one
gravely said the days were too long the other that he was too poor 
the number of horses and the profusion of food are the destruction of
all industry moreover there are so many feast-days and again 
nothing can succeed without it be begun when the moon is on the
increase so that half the month is lost from these two causes 

police and justice are quite inefficient if a man who is poor commits
murder and is taken he will be imprisoned and perhaps even shot but
if he is rich and has friends he may rely on it no very severe
consequence will ensue it is curious that the most respectable
inhabitants of the country invariably assist a murderer to escape they
seem to think that the individual sins against the government and not
against the people a traveller has no protection besides his
fire-arms and the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to
more frequent robberies the character of the higher and more educated
classes who reside in the towns partakes but perhaps in a lesser
degree of the good parts of the gaucho but is i fear stained by
many vices of which he is free sensuality mockery of all religion 
and the grossest corruption are far from uncommon nearly every
public officer can be bribed the head man in the post-office sold
forged government franks the governor and prime minister openly
combined to plunder the state justice where gold came into play was
hardly expected by any one i knew an englishman who went to the
chief justice he told me that not then understanding the ways of the
place he trembled as he entered the room and said sir i have come
to offer you two hundred paper dollars value about five pounds
sterling if you will arrest before a certain time a man who has
cheated me i know it is against the law but my lawyer naming him 
recommended me to take this step the chief justice smiled
acquiescence thanked him and the man before night was safe in prison 
with this entire want of principle in many of the leading men with the
country full of ill-paid turbulent officers the people yet hope that a
democratic form of government can succeed 

on first entering society in these countries two or three features
strike one as particularly remarkable the polite and dignified
manners pervading every rank of life the excellent taste displayed by
the women in their dresses and the equality amongst all ranks at the
rio colorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with
general rosas a son of a major at bahia blanca gained his livelihood
by making paper cigars and he wished to accompany me as guide or
servant to buenos ayres but his father objected on the score of the
danger alone many officers in the army can neither read nor write 
yet all meet in society as equals in entre rios the sala consisted
of only six representatives one of them kept a common shop and
evidently was not degraded by the office all this is what would be
expected in a new country nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by
profession appears to an englishman something strange 

when speaking of these countries the manner in which they have been
brought up by their unnatural parent spain should always be borne in
mind on the whole perhaps more credit is due for what has been
done than blame for that which may be deficient it is impossible to
doubt but that the extreme liberalism of these countries must
ultimately lead to good results the very general toleration of
foreign religions the regard paid to the means of education the
freedom of the press the facilities offered to all foreigners and
especially as i am bound to add to every one professing the humblest
pretensions to science should be recollected with gratitude by those
who have visited spanish south america 

december th the beagle sailed from the rio plata never again to
enter its muddy stream our course was directed to port desire on the
coast of patagonia before proceeding any further i will here put
together a few observations made at sea 

several times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the
plata and at other times when off the shores of northern patagonia we
have been surrounded by insects one evening when we were about ten
miles from the bay of san blas vast numbers of butterflies in bands
or flocks of countless myriads extended as far as the eye could range 
even by the aid of a telescope it was not possible to see a space free
from butterflies the seamen cried out it was snowing butterflies 
and such in fact was the appearance more species than one were
present but the main part belonged to a kind very similar to but not
identical with the common english colias edusa some moths and
hymenoptera accompanied the butterflies and a fine beetle calosoma 
flew on board other instances are known of this beetle having been
caught far out at sea and this is the more remarkable as the greater
number of the carabidae seldom or never take wing the day had been
fine and calm and the one previous to it equally so with light and
variable airs hence we cannot suppose that the insects were blown off
the land but we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight the
great bands of the colias seem at first to afford an instance like
those on record of the migrations of another butterfly vanessa cardui 
 but the presence of other insects makes the case distinct and even
less intelligible before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the
north and this must have caused tens of thousands of the butterflies
and other insects to have perished 

on another occasion when seventeen miles off cape corrientes i had a
net overboard to catch pelagic animals upon drawing it up to my
surprise i found a considerable number of beetles in it and although
in the open sea they did not appear much injured by the salt water i
lost some of the specimens but those which i preserved belonged to the
genera colymbetes hydroporus hydrobius two species notaphus 
cynucus adimonia and scarabaeus at first i thought that these
insects had been blown from the shore but upon reflecting that out of
the eight species four were aquatic and two others partly so in their
habits it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the
sea by a small stream which drains a lake near cape corrientes on any
supposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects
swimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of
land there are several accounts of insects having been blown off the
patagonian shore captain cook observed it as did more lately captain
king of the adventure the cause probably is due to the want of
shelter both of trees and hills so that an insect on the wing with an
off-shore breeze would be very apt to be blown out to sea the most
remarkable instance i have known of an insect being caught far from the
land was that of a large grasshopper acrydium which flew on board 
when the beagle was to windward of the cape de verd islands and when
the nearest point of land not directly opposed to the trade-wind was
cape blanco on the coast of africa miles distant 

on several occasions when the beagle has been within the mouth of the
plata the rigging has been coated with the web of the gossamer spider 
one day november st i paid particular attention to this
subject the weather had been fine and clear and in the morning the
air was full of patches of the flocculent web as on an autumnal day in
england the ship was sixty miles distant from the land in the
direction of a steady though light breeze vast numbers of a small
spider about one-tenth of an inch in length and of a dusky red
colour were attached to the webs there must have been i should
suppose some thousands on the ship the little spider when first
coming in contact with the rigging was always seated on a single
thread and not on the flocculent mass this latter seems merely to be
produced by the entanglement of the single threads the spiders were
all of one species but of both sexes together with young ones these
latter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour 
i will not give the description of this spider but merely state that
it does not appear to me to be included in any of latreille s genera 
the little aeronaut as soon as it arrived on board was very active 
running about sometimes letting itself fall and then reascending the
same thread sometimes employing itself in making a small and very
irregular mesh in the corners between the ropes it could run with
facility on the surface of the water when disturbed it lifted up its
front legs in the attitude of attention on its first arrival it
appeared very thirsty and with exserted maxillae drank eagerly of
drops of water this same circumstance has been observed by strack may
it not be in consequence of the little insect having passed through a
dry and rarefied atmosphere its stock of web seemed inexhaustible 
while watching some that were suspended by a single thread i several
times observed that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of
sight in a horizontal line 

on another occasion th under similar circumstances i repeatedly
observed the same kind of small spider either when placed or having
crawled on some little eminence elevate its abdomen send forth a
thread and then sail away horizontally but with a rapidity which was
quite unaccountable i thought i could perceive that the spider 
before performing the above preparatory steps connected its legs
together with the most delicate threads but i am not sure whether this
observation was correct 

one day at st fe i had a better opportunity of observing some
similar facts a spider which was about three-tenths of an inch in
length and which in its general appearance resembled a citigrade
 therefore quite different from the gossamer while standing on the
summit of a post darted forth four or five threads from its spinners 
these glittering in the sunshine might be compared to diverging rays
of light they were not however straight but in undulations like
films of silk blown by the wind they were more than a yard in length 
and diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices the spider
then suddenly let go its hold of the post and was quickly borne out of
sight the day was hot and apparently calm yet under such
circumstances the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect
a vane so delicate as the thread of a spider s web if during a warm
day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank or over
a level plain at a distant landmark the effect of an ascending current
of heated air is almost always evident such upward currents it has
been remarked are also shown by the ascent of soap-bubbles which will
not rise in an in-doors room hence i think there is not much
difficulty in understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from
a spider s spinners and afterwards of the spider itself the
divergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained i believe
by mr murray by their similar electrical condition the circumstance
of spiders of the same species but of different sexes and ages being
found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the
land attached in vast numbers to the lines renders it probable that
the habit of sailing through the air is as characteristic of this
tribe as that of diving is of the argyroneta we may then reject
latreille s supposition that the gossamer owes its origin
indifferently to the young of several genera of spiders although as
we have seen the young of other spiders do possess the power of
performing aerial voyages 

during our different passages south of the plata i often towed astern
a net made of bunting and thus caught many curious animals of
crustacea there were many strange and undescribed genera one which
in some respects is allied to the notopods or those crabs which have
their posterior legs placed almost on their backs for the purpose of
adhering to the under side of rocks is very remarkable from the
structure of its hind pair of legs the penultimate joint instead of
terminating in a simple claw ends in three bristle-like appendages of
dissimilar lengths the longest equalling that of the entire leg these
claws are very thin and are serrated with the finest teeth directed
backwards their curved extremities are flattened and on this part
five most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner
as the suckers on the arms of the cuttle-fish as the animal lives in
the open sea and probably wants a place of rest i suppose this
beautiful and most anomalous structure is adapted to take hold of
floating marine animals 

in deep water far from the land the number of living creatures is
extremely small south of the latitude degs i never succeeded in
catching anything besides some beroe and a few species of minute
entomostracous crustacea in shoaler water at the distance of a few
miles from the coast very many kinds of crustacea and some other
animals are numerous but only during the night between latitudes 
and degs south of cape horn the net was put astern several times 
it never however brought up anything besides a few of two extremely
minute species of entomostraca yet whales and seals petrels and
albatross are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean 
it has always been a mystery to me on what the albatross which lives
far from the shore can subsist i presume that like the condor it is
able to fast long and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid
whale lasts for a long time the central and intertropical parts of
the atlantic swarm with pteropoda crustacea and radiata and with
their devourers the flying-fish and again with their devourers the
bonitos and albicores i presume that the numerous lower pelagic
animals feed on the infusoria which are now known from the researches
of ehrenberg to abound in the open ocean but on what in the clear
blue water do these infusoria subsist 

while sailing a little south of the plata on one very dark night the
sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle there was a
fresh breeze and every part of the surface which during the day is
seen as foam now glowed with a pale light the vessel drove before
her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus and in her wake she was
followed by a milky train as far as the eye reached the crest of
every wave was bright and the sky above the horizon from the
reflected glare of these livid flames was not so utterly obscure as
over the vault of the heavens 

as we proceed further southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent and
off cape horn i do not recollect more than once having seen it so and
then it was far from being brilliant this circumstance probably has a
close connection with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of
the ocean after the elaborate paper by ehrenberg on the
phosphorescence of the sea it is almost superfluous on my part to make
any observations on the subject i may however add that the same torn
and irregular particles of gelatinous matter described by ehrenberg 
seem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere to be the
common cause of this phenomenon the particles were so minute as
easily to pass through fine gauze yet many were distinctly visible by
the naked eye the water when placed in a tumbler and agitated gave
out sparks but a small portion in a watch-glass scarcely ever was
luminous ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain
degree of irritability my observations some of which were made
directly after taking up the water gave a different result i may
also mention that having used the net during one night i allowed it
to become partially dry and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to
employ it again i found the whole surface sparkled as brightly as when
first taken out of the water it does not appear probable in this case 
that the particles could have remained so long alive on one occasion
having kept a jelly-fish of the genus dianaea till it was dead the
water in which it was placed became luminous when the waves
scintillate with bright green sparks i believe it is generally owing
to minute crustacea but there can be no doubt that very many other
pelagic animals when alive are phosphorescent 

on two occasions i have observed the sea luminous at considerable
depths beneath the surface near the mouth of the plata some circular
and oval patches from two to four yards in diameter and with defined
outlines shone with a steady but pale light while the surrounding
water only gave out a few sparks the appearance resembled the
reflection of the moon or some luminous body for the edges were
sinuous from the undulations of the surface the ship which drew
thirteen feet of water passed over without disturbing these patches 
therefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together
at a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel 

near fernando noronha the sea gave out light in flashes the appearance
was very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish
moving rapidly through a luminous fluid to this cause the sailors
attributed it at the time however i entertained some doubts on
account of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes i have already
remarked that the phenomenon is very much more common in warm than in
cold countries and i have sometimes imagined that a disturbed
electrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its
production certainly i think the sea is most luminous after a few
days of more calm weather than ordinary during which time it has
swarmed with various animals observing that the water charged with
gelatinous particles is in an impure state and that the luminous
appearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the
fluid in contact with the atmosphere i am inclined to consider that
the phosphorescence is the result of the decomposition of the organic
particles by which process one is tempted almost to call it a kind of
respiration the ocean becomes purified 

december rd we arrived at port desire situated in lat degs 
on the coast of patagonia the creek runs for about twenty miles
inland with an irregular width the beagle anchored a few miles
within the entrance in front of the ruins of an old spanish settlement 

the same evening i went on shore the first landing in any new country
is very interesting and especially when as in this case the whole
aspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character at the
height of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of
porphyry a wide plain extends which is truly characteristic of
patagonia the surface is quite level and is composed of well-rounded
shingle mixed with a whitish earth here and there scattered tufts of
brown wiry grass are supported and still more rarely some low thorny
bushes the weather is dry and pleasant and the fine blue sky is but
seldom obscured when standing in the middle of one of these desert
plains and looking towards the interior the view is generally bounded
by the escarpment of another plain rather higher but equally level
and desolate and in every other direction the horizon is indistinct
from the trembling mirage which seems to rise from the heated surface 

in such a country the fate of the spanish settlement was soon decided 
the dryness of the climate during the greater part of the year and the
occasional hostile attacks of the wandering indians compelled the
colonists to desert their half-finished buildings the style however 
in which they were commenced shows the strong and liberal hand of spain
in the old time the result of all the attempts to colonize this side
of america south of degs has been miserable port famine
expresses by its name the lingering and extreme sufferings of several
hundred wretched people of whom one alone survived to relate their
misfortunes at st joseph s bay on the coast of patagonia a small
settlement was made but during one sunday the indians made an attack
and massacred the whole party excepting two men who remained captives
during many years at the rio negro i conversed with one of these men 
now in extreme old age 

the zoology of patagonia is as limited as its flora on the arid
plains a few black beetles heteromera might be seen slowly crawling
about and occasionally a lizard darted from side to side of birds we
have three carrion hawks and in the valleys a few finches and
insect-feeders an ibis theristicus melanops a species said to be
found in central africa is not uncommon on the most desert parts in
their stomachs i found grasshoppers cicadae small lizards and even
scorpions at one time of the year these birds go in flocks at
another in pairs their cry is very loud and singular like the
neighing of the guanaco 

the guanaco or wild llama is the characteristic quadruped of the
plains of patagonia it is the south american representative of the
camel of the east it is an elegant animal in a state of nature with
a long slender neck and fine legs it is very common over the whole of
the temperate parts of the continent as far south as the islands near
cape horn it generally lives in small herds of from half a dozen to
thirty in each but on the banks of the st cruz we saw one herd which
must have contained at least five hundred 

they are generally wild and extremely wary mr stokes told me that
he one day saw through a glass a herd of these animals which evidently
had been frightened and were running away at full speed although
their distance was so great that he could not distinguish them with his
naked eye the sportsman frequently receives the first notice of their
presence by hearing from a long distance their peculiar shrill
neighing note of alarm if he then looks attentively he will probably
see the herd standing in a line on the side of some distant hill on
approaching nearer a few more squeals are given and off they set at
an apparently slow but really quick canter along some narrow beaten
track to a neighbouring hill if however by chance he abruptly meets
a single animal or several together they will generally stand
motionless and intently gaze at him then perhaps move on a few yards 
turn round and look again what is the cause of this difference in
their shyness do they mistake a man in the distance for their chief
enemy the puma or does curiosity overcome their timidity that they
are curious is certain for if a person lies on the ground and plays
strange antics such as throwing up his feet in the air they will
almost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him it was an
artifice that was repeatedly practised by our sportsmen with success 
and it had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be
fired which were all taken as parts of the performance on the
mountains of tierra del fuego i have more than once seen a guanaco on
being approached not only neigh and squeal but prance and leap about
in the most ridiculous manner apparently in defiance as a challenge 
these animals are very easily domesticated and i have seen some thus
kept in northern patagonia near a house though not under any
restraint they are in this state very bold and readily attack a man
by striking him from behind with both knees it is asserted that the
motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of their females the
wild guanacos however have no idea of defence even a single dog will
secure one of these large animals till the huntsman can come up in
many of their habits they are like sheep in a flock thus when they see
men approaching in several directions on horseback they soon become
bewildered and know not which way to run this greatly facilitates
the indian method of hunting for they are thus easily driven to a
central point and are encompassed 

the guanacos readily take to the water several times at port valdes
they were seen swimming from island to island byron in his voyage
says he saw them drinking salt water some of our officers likewise saw
a herd apparently drinking the briny fluid from a salina near cape
blanco i imagine in several parts of the country if they do not
drink salt water they drink none at all in the middle of the day
they frequently roll in the dust in saucer-shaped hollows the males
fight together two one day passed quite close to me squealing and
trying to bite each other and several were shot with their hides
deeply scored herds sometimes appear to set out on exploring parties 
at bahia blanca where within thirty miles of the coast these animals
are extremely unfrequent i one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty 
which had come in a direct line to a muddy salt-water creek they then
must have perceived that they were approaching the sea for they had
wheeled with the regularity of cavalry and had returned back in as
straight a line as they had advanced the guanacos have one singular
habit which is to me quite inexplicable namely that on successive
days they drop their dung in the same defined heap i saw one of these
heaps which was eight feet in diameter and was composed of a large
quantity this habit according to m a d orbigny is common to all
the species of the genus it is very useful to the peruvian indians 
who use the dung for fuel and are thus saved the trouble of collecting
it 

the guanacos appear to have favourite spots for lying down to die on
the banks of the st cruz in certain circumscribed spaces which were
generally bushy and all near the river the ground was actually white
with bones on one such spot i counted between ten and twenty heads i
particularly examined the bones they did not appear as some scattered
ones which i had seen gnawed or broken as if dragged together by
beasts of prey the animals in most cases must have crawled before
dying beneath and amongst the bushes mr bynoe informs me that
during a former voyage he observed the same circumstance on the banks
of the rio gallegos i do not at all understand the reason of this 
but i may observe that the wounded guanacos at the st cruz invariably
walked towards the river at st jago in the cape de verd islands i
remember having seen in a ravine a retired corner covered with bones of
the goat we at the time exclaimed that it was the burial ground of all
the goats in the island i mention these trifling circumstances 
because in certain cases they might explain the occurrence of a number
of uninjured bones in a cave or buried under alluvial accumulations 
and likewise the cause why certain animals are more commonly embedded
than others in sedimentary deposits 

one day the yawl was sent under the command of mr chaffers with three
days provisions to survey the upper part of the harbour in the
morning we searched for some watering-places mentioned in an old
spanish chart we found one creek at the head of which there was a
trickling rill the first we had seen of brackish water here the
tide compelled us to wait several hours and in the interval i walked
some miles into the interior the plain as usual consisted of gravel 
mingled with soil resembling chalk in appearance but very different
from it in nature from the softness of these materials it was worn
into many gulleys there was not a tree and excepting the guanaco 
which stood on the hill-top a watchful sentinel over its herd scarcely
an animal or a bird all was stillness and desolation yet in passing
over these scenes without one bright object near an ill-defined but
strong sense of pleasure is vividly excited one asked how many ages
the plain had thus lasted and how many more it was doomed thus to
continue 

 none can reply all seems eternal now the wilderness has a mysterious
tongue which teaches awful doubt 

in the evening we sailed a few miles further up and then pitched the
tents for the night by the middle of the next day the yawl was
aground and from the shoalness of the water could not proceed any
higher the water being found partly fresh mr chaffers took the
dingey and went up two or three miles further where she also grounded 
but in a fresh-water river the water was muddy and though the stream
was most insignificant in size it would be difficult to account for
its origin except from the melting snow on the cordillera at the
spot where we bivouacked we were surrounded by bold cliffs and steep
pinnacles of porphyry i do not think i ever saw a spot which appeared
more secluded from the rest of the world than this rocky crevice in
the wide plain 

the second day after our return to the anchorage a party of officers
and myself went to ransack an old indian grave which i had found on
the summit of a neighbouring hill two immense stones each probably
weighing at least a couple of tons had been placed in front of a ledge
of rock about six feet high at the bottom of the grave on the hard
rock there was a layer of earth about a foot deep which must have been
brought up from the plain below above it a pavement of flat stones
was placed on which others were piled so as to fill up the space
between the ledge and the two great blocks to complete the grave the
indians had contrived to detach from the ledge a huge fragment and to
throw it over the pile so as to rest on the two blocks we undermined
the grave on both sides but could not find any relics or even bones 
the latter probably had decayed long since in which case the grave
must have been of extreme antiquity for i found in another place some
smaller heaps beneath which a very few crumbling fragments could yet be
distinguished as having belonged to a man falconer states that where
an indian dies he is buried but that subsequently his bones are
carefully taken up and carried let the distance be ever so great to
be deposited near the sea-coast this custom i think may be
accounted for by recollecting that before the introduction of horses 
these indians must have led nearly the same life as the fuegians now
do and therefore generally have resided in the neighbourhood of the
sea the common prejudice of lying where one s ancestors have lain 
would make the now roaming indians bring the less perishable part of
their dead to their ancient burial-ground on the coast 

january th before it was dark the beagle anchored in the fine
spacious harbour of port st julian situated about one hundred and ten
miles to the south of port desire we remained here eight days the
country is nearly similar to that of port desire but perhaps rather
more sterile one day a party accompanied captain fitz roy on a long
walk round the head of the harbour we were eleven hours without
tasting any water and some of the party were quite exhausted from
the summit of a hill since well named thirsty hill a fine lake was
spied and two of the party proceeded with concerted signals to show
whether it was fresh water what was our disappointment to find a
snow-white expanse of salt crystallized in great cubes we attributed
our extreme thirst to the dryness of the atmosphere but whatever the
cause might be we were exceedingly glad late in the evening to get
back to the boats although we could nowhere find during our whole
visit a single drop of fresh water yet some must exist for by an odd
chance i found on the surface of the salt water near the head of the
bay a colymbetes not quite dead which must have lived in some not far
distant pool three other insects a cincindela like hybrida a
cymindis and a harpalus which all live on muddy flats occasionally
overflowed by the sea and one other found dead on the plain complete
the list of the beetles a good-sized fly tabanus was extremely
numerous and tormented us by its painful bite the common horsefly 
which is so troublesome in the shady lanes of england belongs to this
same genus we here have the puzzle that so frequently occurs in the
case of musquitoes on the blood of what animals do these insects
commonly feed the guanaco is nearly the only warm-blooded quadruped 
and it is found in quite inconsiderable numbers compared with the
multitude of flies 

the geology of patagonia is interesting differently from europe 
where the tertiary formations appear to have accumulated in bays here
along hundreds of miles of coast we have one great deposit including
many tertiary shells all apparently extinct the most common shell is
a massive gigantic oyster sometimes even a foot in diameter these
beds are covered by others of a peculiar soft white stone including
much gypsum and resembling chalk but really of a pumiceous nature it
is highly remarkable from being composed to at least one-tenth of its
bulk of infusoria professor ehrenberg has already ascertained in it
thirty oceanic forms this bed extends for miles along the coast 
and probably for a considerably greater distance at port st julian
its thickness is more than feet these white beds are everywhere
capped by a mass of gravel forming probably one of the largest beds of
shingle in the world it certainly extends from near the rio colorado
to between and nautical miles southward at santa cruz a river
a little south of st julian it reaches to the foot of the
cordillera half way up the river its thickness is more than feet 
it probably everywhere extends to this great chain whence the
well-rounded pebbles of porphyry have been derived we may consider its
average breadth as miles and its average thickness as about 
feet if this great bed of pebbles without including the mud
necessarily derived from their attrition was piled into a mound it
would form a great mountain chain when we consider that all these
pebbles countless as the grains of sand in the desert have been
derived from the slow falling of masses of rock on the old coast-lines
and banks of rivers and that these fragments have been dashed into
smaller pieces and that each of them has since been slowly rolled 
rounded and far transported the mind is stupefied in thinking over the
long absolutely necessary lapse of years yet all this gravel has
been transported and probably rounded subsequently to the deposition
of the white beds and long subsequently to the underlying beds with
the tertiary shells 

everything in this southern continent has been effected on a grand
scale the land from the rio plata to tierra del fuego a distance of
 miles has been raised in mass and in patagonia to a height of
between and feet within the period of the now existing
sea-shells the old and weathered shells left on the surface of the
upraised plain still partially retain their colours the uprising
movement has been interrupted by at least eight long periods of rest 
during which the sea ate deeply back into the land forming at
successive levels the long lines of cliffs or escarpments which
separate the different plains as they rise like steps one behind the
other the elevatory movement and the eating-back power of the sea
during the periods of rest have been equable over long lines of coast 
for i was astonished to find that the step-like plains stand at nearly
corresponding heights at far distant points the lowest plain is 
feet high and the highest which i ascended near the coast is 
feet and of this only relics are left in the form of flat
gravel-capped hills the upper plain of santa cruz slopes up to a
height of feet at the foot of the cordillera i have said that
within the period of existing sea-shells patagonia has been upraised
 to feet i may add that within the period when icebergs
transported boulders over the upper plain of santa cruz the elevation
has been at least feet nor has patagonia been affected only by
upward movements the extinct tertiary shells from port st julian and
santa cruz cannot have lived according to professor e forbes in a
greater depth of water than from to feet but they are now
covered with sea-deposited strata from to feet in thickness 
hence the bed of the sea on which these shells once lived must have
sunk downwards several hundred feet to allow of the accumulation of
the superincumbent strata what a history of geological changes does
the simply-constructed coast of patagonia reveal 

at port st julian in some red mud capping the gravel on the
feet plain i found half the skeleton of the macrauchenia
patachonica a remarkable quadruped full as large as a camel it
belongs to the same division of the pachydermata with the rhinoceros 
tapir and palaeotherium but in the structure of the bones of its long
neck it shows a clear relation to the camel or rather to the guanaco
and llama from recent sea-shells being found on two of the higher
step-formed plains which must have been modelled and upraised before
the mud was deposited in which the macrauchenia was entombed it is
certain that this curious quadruped lived long after the sea was
inhabited by its present shells i was at first much surprised how a
large quadruped could so lately have subsisted in lat degs 
on these wretched gravel plains with their stunted vegetation but the
relationship of the macrauchenia to the guanaco now an inhabitant of
the most sterile parts partly explains this difficulty 

the relationship though distant between the macrauchenia and the
guanaco between the toxodon and the capybara the closer relationship
between the many extinct edentata and the living sloths ant-eaters 
and armadillos now so eminently characteristic of south american
zoology and the still closer relationship between the fossil and
living species of ctenomys and hydrochaerus are most interesting
facts this relationship is shown wonderfully as wonderfully as
between the fossil and extinct marsupial animals of australia by the
great collection lately brought to europe from the caves of brazil by
mm lund and clausen in this collection there are extinct species of
all the thirty-two genera excepting four of the terrestrial
quadrupeds now inhabiting the provinces in which the caves occur and
the extinct species are much more numerous than those now living there
are fossil ant-eaters armadillos tapirs peccaries guanacos 
opossums and numerous south american gnawers and monkeys and other
animals this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the
dead and the living will i do not doubt hereafter throw more light
on the appearance of organic beings on our earth and their
disappearance from it than any other class of facts 

it is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the american
continent without the deepest astonishment formerly it must have
swarmed with great monsters now we find mere pigmies compared with
the antecedent allied races if buffon had known of the gigantic
sloth and armadillo-like animals and of the lost pachydermata he
might have said with a greater semblance of truth that the creative
force in america had lost its power rather than that it had never
possessed great vigour the greater number if not all of these
extinct quadrupeds lived at a late period and were the contemporaries
of most of the existing sea-shells since they lived no very great
change in the form of the land can have taken place what then has
exterminated so many species and whole genera the mind at first is
irresistibly hurried into the belief of some great catastrophe but
thus to destroy animals both large and small in southern patagonia 
in brazil on the cordillera of peru in north america up to behring s
straits we must shake the entire framework of the globe an
examination moreover of the geology of la plata and patagonia leads
to the belief that all the features of the land result from slow and
gradual changes it appears from the character of the fossils in
europe asia australia and in north and south america that those
conditions which favour the life of the larger quadrupeds were lately
co-extensive with the world what those conditions were no one has yet
even conjectured it could hardly have been a change of temperature 
which at about the same time destroyed the inhabitants of tropical 
temperate and arctic latitudes on both sides of the globe in north
america we positively know from mr lyell that the large quadrupeds
lived subsequently to that period when boulders were brought into
latitudes at which icebergs now never arrive from conclusive but
indirect reasons we may feel sure that in the southern hemisphere the
macrauchenia also lived long subsequently to the ice-transporting
boulder-period did man after his first inroad into south america 
destroy as has been suggested the unwieldy megatherium and the other
edentata we must at least look to some other cause for the
destruction of the little tucutuco at bahia blanca and of the many
fossil mice and other small quadrupeds in brazil no one will imagine
that a drought even far severer than those which cause such losses in
the provinces of la plata could destroy every individual of every
species from southern patagonia to behring s straits what shall we
say of the extinction of the horse did those plains fail of pasture 
which have since been overrun by thousands and hundreds of thousands of
the descendants of the stock introduced by the spaniards have the
subsequently introduced species consumed the food of the great
antecedent races can we believe that the capybara has taken the food
of the toxodon the guanaco of the macrauchenia the existing small
edentata of their numerous gigantic prototypes certainly no fact in
the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated
exterminations of its inhabitants 

nevertheless if we consider the subject under another point of view 
it will appear less perplexing we do not steadily bear in mind how
profoundly ignorant we are of the conditions of existence of every
animal nor do we always remember that some check is constantly
preventing the too rapid increase of every organized being left in a
state of nature the supply of food on an average remains constant 
yet the tendency in every animal to increase by propagation is
geometrical and its surprising effects have nowhere been more
astonishingly shown than in the case of the european animals run wild
during the last few centuries in america every animal in a state of
nature regularly breeds yet in a species long established any great 
increase in numbers is obviously impossible and must be checked by
some means we are nevertheless seldom able with certainty to tell in
any given species at what period of life or at what period of the
year or whether only at long intervals the check falls or again 
what is the precise nature of the check hence probably it is that we
feel so little surprise at one of two species closely allied in
habits being rare and the other abundant in the same district or 
again that one should be abundant in one district and another 
filling the same place in the economy of nature should be abundant in
a neighbouring district differing very little in its conditions if
asked how this is one immediately replies that it is determined by
some slight difference in climate food or the number of enemies yet
how rarely if ever we can point out the precise cause and manner of
action of the check we are therefore driven to the conclusion that
causes generally quite inappreciable by us determine whether a given
species shall be abundant or scanty in numbers 

in the cases where we can trace the extinction of a species through
man either wholly or in one limited district we know that it becomes
rarer and rarer and is then lost it would be difficult to point out
any just distinction between a species destroyed by man or by the
increase of its natural enemies the evidence of rarity preceding
extinction is more striking in the successive tertiary strata as
remarked by several able observers it has often been found that a
shell very common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare and has even
long been thought extinct if then as appears probable species first
become rare and then extinct if the too rapid increase of every
species even the most favoured is steadily checked as we must admit 
though how and when it is hard to say and if we see without the
smallest surprise though unable to assign the precise reason one
species abundant and another closely allied species rare in the same
district why should we feel such great astonishment at the rarity
being carried one step further to extinction an action going on on
every side of us and yet barely appreciable might surely be carried a
little further without exciting our observation who would feel any
great surprise at hearing that the magalonyx was formerly rare compared
with the megatherium or that one of the fossil monkeys was few in
number compared with one of the now living monkeys and yet in this
comparative rarity we should have the plainest evidence of less
favourable conditions for their existence to admit that species
generally become rare before they become extinct to feel no surprise
at the comparative rarity of one species with another and yet to call
in some extraordinary agent and to marvel greatly when a species ceases
to exist appears to me much the same as to admit that sickness in the
individual is the prelude to death to feel no surprise at
sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to believe that he
died through violence 

 mr waterhouse has drawn up a detailed description of this head 
which i hope he will publish in some journal

chapter ix

santa cruz patagonia and the falkland islands

santa cruz expedition up the river indians immense streams of
basaltic lava fragments not transported by the river excavations of
the valley condor habits of cordillera erratic boulders of great
size indian relics return to the ship falkland islands wild
horses cattle rabbits wolf-like fox fire made of bones manner of
hunting wild cattle geology streams of stones scenes of
violence penguins geese eggs of doris compound animals 


april the beagle anchored within the mouth of the santa
cruz this river is situated about sixty miles south of port st 
julian during the last voyage captain stokes proceeded thirty miles
up it but then from the want of provisions was obliged to return 
excepting what was discovered at that time scarcely anything was known
about this large river captain fitz roy now determined to follow its
course as far as time would allow on the th three whale-boats
started carrying three weeks provisions and the party consisted of
twenty-five souls a force which would have been sufficient to have
defied a host of indians with a strong flood-tide and a fine day we
made a good run soon drank some of the fresh water and were at night
nearly above the tidal influence 

the river here assumed a size and appearance which even at the highest
point we ultimately reached was scarcely diminished it was generally
from three to four hundred yards broad and in the middle about
seventeen feet deep the rapidity of the current which in its whole
course runs at the rate of from four to six knots an hour is perhaps
its most remarkable feature the water is of a fine blue colour but
with a slight milky tinge and not so transparent as at first sight
would have been expected it flows over a bed of pebbles like those
which compose the beach and the surrounding plains it runs in a
winding course through a valley which extends in a direct line
westward this valley varies from five to ten miles in breadth it is
bounded by step-formed terraces which rise in most parts one above
the other to the height of five hundred feet and have on the opposite
sides a remarkable correspondence 

april th against so strong a current it was of course quite
impossible to row or sail consequently the three boats were fastened
together head and stern two hands left in each and the rest came on
shore to track as the general arrangements made by captain fitz roy
were very good for facilitating the work of all and as all had a share
in it i will describe the system the party including every one was
divided into two spells each of which hauled at the tracking line
alternately for an hour and a half the officers of each boat lived
with ate the same food and slept in the same tent with their crew so
that each boat was quite independent of the others after sunset the
first level spot where any bushes were growing was chosen for our
night s lodging each of the crew took it in turns to be cook 
immediately the boat was hauled up the cook made his fire two others
pitched the tent the coxswain handed the things out of the boat the
rest carried them up to the tents and collected firewood by this
order in half an hour everything was ready for the night a watch of
two men and an officer was always kept whose duty it was to look after
the boats keep up the fire and guard against indians each in the
party had his one hour every night 

during this day we tracked but a short distance for there were many
islets covered by thorny bushes and the channels between them were
shallow 

april th we passed the islands and set to work our regular day s
march although it was hard enough carried us on an average only ten
miles in a straight line and perhaps fifteen or twenty altogether 
beyond the place where we slept last night the country is completely
 terra incognita for it was there that captain stokes turned back we
saw in the distance a great smoke and found the skeleton of a horse 
so we knew that indians were in the neighbourhood on the next morning
 st tracks of a party of horse and marks left by the trailing of the
chuzos or long spears were observed on the ground it was generally
thought that the indians had reconnoitred us during the night shortly
afterwards we came to a spot where from the fresh footsteps of men 
children and horses it was evident that the party had crossed the
river 

april nd the country remained the same and was extremely
uninteresting the complete similarity of the productions throughout
patagonia is one of its most striking characters the level plains of
arid shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants and in the
valleys the same thorn-bearing bushes grow everywhere we see the same
birds and insects even the very banks of the river and of the clear
streamlets which entered it were scarcely enlivened by a brighter tint
of green the curse of sterility is on the land and the water flowing
over a bed of pebbles partakes of the same curse hence the number of
water-fowls is very scanty for there is nothing to support life in the
stream of this barren river 

patagonia poor as she is in some respects can however boast of a
greater stock of small rodents than perhaps any other country in
the world several species of mice are externally characterized by
large thin ears and a very fine fur these little animals swarm
amongst the thickets in the valleys where they cannot for months
together taste a drop of water excepting the dew they all seem to be
cannibals for no sooner was a mouse caught in one of my traps that it
was devoured by others a small and delicately shaped fox which is
likewise very abundant probably derives its entire support from these
small animals the guanaco is also in his proper district herds of
fifty or a hundred were common and as i have stated we saw one which
must have contained at least five hundred the puma with the condor
and other carrion-hawks in its train follows and preys upon these
animals the footsteps of the puma were to be seen almost everywhere
on the banks of the river and the remains of several guanacos with
their necks dislocated and bones broken showed how they had met their
death 

april th like the navigators of old when approaching an unknown
land we examined and watched for the most trivial sign of a change 
the drifted trunk of a tree or a boulder of primitive rock was hailed
with joy as if we had seen a forest growing on the flanks of the
cordillera the top however of a heavy bank of clouds which
remained almost constantly in one position was the most promising
sign and eventually turned out a true harbinger at first the clouds
were mistaken for the mountains themselves instead of the masses of
vapour condensed by their icy summits 

april th we this day met with a marked change in the geological
structure of the plains from the first starting i had carefully
examined the gravel in the river and for the two last days had noticed
the presence of a few small pebbles of a very cellular basalt these
gradually increased in number and in size but none were as large as a
man s head this morning however pebbles of the same rock but more
compact suddenly became abundant and in the course of half an hour we
saw at the distance of five of six miles the angular edge of a great
basaltic platform when we arrived at its base we found the stream
bubbling among the fallen blocks for the next twenty-eight miles the
river-course was encumbered with these basaltic masses above that
limit immense fragments of primitive rocks derived from its
surrounding boulder-formation were equally numerous none of the
fragments of any considerable size had been washed more than three or
four miles down the river below their parent-source considering the
singular rapidity of the great body of water in the santa cruz and
that no still reaches occur in any part this example is a most
striking one of the inefficiency of rivers in transporting even
moderately-sized fragments 

the basalt is only lava which has flowed beneath the sea but the
eruptions must have been on the grandest scale at the point where we
first met this formation it was feet in thickness following up the
river course the surface imperceptibly rose and the mass became
thicker so that at forty miles above the first station it was feet
thick what the thickness may be close to the cordillera i have no
means of knowing but the platform there attains a height of about
three thousand feet above the level of the sea we must therefore look
to the mountains of that great chain for its source and worthy of such
a source are streams that have flowed over the gently inclined bed of
the sea to a distance of one hundred miles at the first glance of the
basaltic cliffs on the opposite sides of the valley it was evident
that the strata once were united what power then has removed along
a whole line of country a solid mass of very hard rock which had an
average thickness of nearly three hundred feet and a breadth varying
from rather less than two miles to four miles the river though it
has so little power in transporting even inconsiderable fragments yet
in the lapse of ages might produce by its gradual erosion an effect of
which it is difficult to judge the amount but in this case 
independently of the insignificance of such an agency good reasons can
be assigned for believing that this valley was formerly occupied by an
arm of the sea it is needless in this work to detail the arguments
leading to this conclusion derived from the form and the nature of the
step-formed terraces on both sides of the valley from the manner in
which the bottom of the valley near the andes expands into a great
estuary-like plain with sand-hillocks on it and from the occurrence of
a few sea-shells lying in the bed of the river if i had space i could
prove that south america was formerly here cut off by a strait joining
the atlantic and pacific oceans like that of magellan but it may yet
be asked how has the solid basalt been moved geologists formerly
would have brought into play the violent action of some overwhelming
debacle but in this case such a supposition would have been quite
inadmissible because the same step-like plains with existing
sea-shells lying on their surface which front the long line of the
patagonian coast sweep up on each side of the valley of santa cruz no
possible action of any flood could thus have modelled the land either
within the valley or along the open coast and by the formation of such
step-like plains or terraces the valley itself had been hollowed out 
although we know that there are tides which run within the narrows of
the strait of magellan at the rate of eight knots an hour yet we must
confess that it makes the head almost giddy to reflect on the number of
years century after century which the tides unaided by a heavy surf 
must have required to have corroded so vast an area and thickness of
solid basaltic lava nevertheless we must believe that the strata
undermined by the waters of this ancient strait were broken up into
huge fragments and these lying scattered on the beach were reduced
first to smaller blocks then to pebbles and lastly to the most
impalpable mud which the tides drifted far into the eastern or western
ocean 

with the change in the geological structure of the plains the character
of the landscape likewise altered while rambling up some of the
narrow and rocky defiles i could almost have fancied myself
transported back again to the barren valleys of the island of st jago 
among the basaltic cliffs i found some plants which i had seen nowhere
else but others i recognised as being wanderers from tierra del fuego 
these porous rocks serve as a reservoir for the scanty rain-water and
consequently on the line where the igneous and sedimentary formations
unite some small springs most rare occurrences in patagonia burst
forth and they could be distinguished at a distance by the
circumscribed patches of bright green herbage 

april th the bed of the river became rather narrower and hence the
stream more rapid it here ran at the rate of six knots an hour from
this cause and from the many great angular fragments tracking the
boats became both dangerous and laborious 


this day i shot a condor it measured from tip to tip of the wings 
eight and a half feet and from beak to tail four feet this bird is
known to have a wide geographical range being found on the west coast
of south america from the strait of magellan along the cordillera as
far as eight degrees north of the equator the steep cliff near the
mouth of the rio negro is its northern limit on the patagonian coast 
and they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great
central line of their habitations in the andes further south among
the bold precipices at the head of port desire the condor is not
uncommon yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the sea-coast a
line of cliff near the mouth of the santa cruz is frequented by these
birds and about eighty miles up the river where the sides of the
valley are formed by steep basaltic precipices the condor reappears 
from these facts it seems that the condors require perpendicular
cliffs in chile they haunt during the greater part of the year the
lower country near the shores of the pacific and at night several
roost together in one tree but in the early part of summer they
retire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner cordillera there to
breed in peace 

with respect to their propagation i was told by the country people in
chile that the condor makes no sort of nest but in the months of
november and december lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare
rock it is said that the young condors cannot fly for an entire year 
and long after they are able they continue to roost by night and hunt
by day with their parents the old birds generally live in pairs but
among the inland basaltic cliffs of the santa cruz i found a spot 
where scores must usually haunt on coming suddenly to the brow of the
precipice it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty of
these great birds start heavily from their resting-place and wheel
away in majestic circles from the quantity of dung on the rocks they
must long have frequented this cliff for roosting and breeding having
gorged themselves with carrion on the plains below they retire to
these favourite ledges to digest their food from these facts the
condor like the gallinazo must to a certain degree be considered as a
gregarious bird in this part of the country they live altogether on
the guanacos which have died a natural death or as more commonly
happens have been killed by the pumas i believe from what i saw in
patagonia that they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily
excursions to any great distance from their regular sleeping-places 

the condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height soaring over a
certain spot in the most graceful circles on some occasions i am sure
that they do this only for pleasure but on others the chileno
countryman tells you that they are watching a dying animal or the puma
devouring its prey if the condors glide down and then suddenly all
rise together the chileno knows that it is the puma which watching
the carcass has sprung out to drive away the robbers besides feeding
on carrion the condors frequently attack young goats and lambs and
the shepherd-dogs are trained whenever they pass over to run out and
looking upwards to bark violently the chilenos destroy and catch
numbers two methods are used one is to place a carcass on a level
piece of ground within an enclosure of sticks with an opening and when
the condors are gorged to gallop up on horseback to the entrance and
thus enclose them for when this bird has not space to run it cannot
give its body sufficient momentum to rise from the ground the second
method is to mark the trees in which frequently to the number of five
or six together they roost and they at night to climb up and noose
them they are such heavy sleepers as i have myself witnessed that
this is not a difficult task at valparaiso i have seen a living
condor sold for sixpence but the common price is eight or ten
shillings one which i saw brought in had been tied with rope and was
much injured yet the moment the line was cut by which its bill was
secured although surrounded by people it began ravenously to tear a
piece of carrion in a garden at the same place between twenty and
thirty were kept alive they were fed only once a week but they
appeared in pretty good health the chileno countrymen assert that
the condor will live and retain its vigour between five and six weeks
without eating i cannot answer for the truth of this but it is a
cruel experiment which very likely has been tried 

when an animal is killed in the country it is well known that the
condors like other carrion-vultures soon gain intelligence of it and
congregate in an inexplicable manner in most cases it must not be
overlooked that the birds have discovered their prey and have picked
the skeleton clean before the flesh is in the least degree tainted 
remembering the experiments of m audubon on the little smelling
powers of carrion-hawks i tried in the above mentioned garden the
following experiment the condors were tied each by a rope in a long
row at the bottom of a wall and having folded up a piece of meat in
white paper i walked backwards and forwards carrying it in my hand at
the distance of about three yards from them but no notice whatever was
taken i then threw it on the ground within one yard of an old male
bird he looked at it for a moment with attention but then regarded it
no more with a stick i pushed it closer and closer until at last he
touched it with his beak the paper was then instantly torn off with
fury and at the same moment every bird in the long row began
struggling and flapping its wings under the same circumstances it
would have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog the evidence
in favour of and against the acute smelling powers of carrion-vultures
is singularly balanced professor owen has demonstrated that the
olfactory nerves of the turkey-buzzard cathartes aura are highly
developed and on the evening when mr owen s paper was read at the
zoological society it was mentioned by a gentleman that he had seen
the carrion-hawks in the west indies on two occasions collect on the
roof of a house when a corpse had become offensive from not having
been buried in this case the intelligence could hardly have been
acquired be sight on the other hand besides the experiments of
audubon and that one by myself mr bachman has tried in the united
states many varied plans showing that neither the turkey-buzzard the
species dissected by professor owen nor the gallinazo find their food
by smell he covered portions of highly-offensive offal with a thin
canvas cloth and strewed pieces of meat on it these the
carrion-vultures ate up and then remained quietly standing with their
beaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid mass without
discovering it a small rent was made in the canvas and the offal was
immediately discovered the canvas was replaced by a fresh piece and
meat again put on it and was again devoured by the vultures without
their discovering the hidden mass on which they were trampling these
facts are attested by the signatures of six gentlemen besides that of
mr bachman 

often when lying down to rest on the open plains on looking upwards i
have seen carrion-hawks sailing through the air at a great height 
where the country is level i do not believe a space of the heavens of
more than fifteen degrees above the horizon is commonly viewed with
any attention by a person either walking or on horseback if such be
the case and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three
and four thousand feet before it could come within the range of
vision its distance in a straight line from the beholder s eye would
be rather more than two british miles might it not thus readily be
overlooked when an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely
valley may he not all the while be watched from above by the
sharp-sighted bird and will not the manner of its descend proclaim
throughout the district to the whole family of carrion-feeders that
their prey is at hand 

when the condors are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot 
their flight is beautiful except when rising from the ground i do
not recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings near
lima i watched several for nearly half an hour without once taking
off my eyes they moved in large curves sweeping in circles 
descending and ascending without giving a single flap as they glided
close over my head i intently watched from an oblique position the
outlines of the separate and great terminal feathers of each wing and
these separate feathers if there had been the least vibratory
movement would have appeared as if blended together but they were
seen distinct against the blue sky the head and neck were moved
frequently and apparently with force and the extended wings seemed to
form the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck body and tail
acted if the bird wished to descend the wings were for a moment
collapsed and when again expanded with an altered inclination the
momentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards
with the even and steady movement of a paper kite in the case of any
bird soaring its motion must be sufficiently rapid so that the action
of the inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may
counterbalance its gravity the force to keep up the momentum of a
body moving in a horizontal plane in the air in which there is so
little friction cannot be great and this force is all that is wanted 
the movements of the neck and body of the condor we must suppose is
sufficient for this however this may be it is truly wonderful and
beautiful to see so great a bird hour after hour without any apparent
exertion wheeling and gliding over mountain and river 

april th from some high land we hailed with joy the white summits
of the cordillera as they were seen occasionally peeping through their
dusky envelope of clouds during the few succeeding days we continued
to get on slowly for we found the river-course very tortuous and
strewed with immense fragments of various ancient slate rocks and of
granite the plain bordering the valley has here attained an elevation
of about feet above the river and its character was much altered 
the well-rounded pebbles of porphyry were mingled with many immense
angular fragments of basalt and of primary rocks the first of these
erratic boulders which i noticed was sixty-seven miles distant from
the nearest mountain another which i measured was five yards square 
and projected five feet above the gravel its edges were so angular 
and its size so great that i at first mistook it for a rock in situ 
and took out my compass to observe the direction of its cleavage the
plain here was not quite so level as that nearer the coast but yet in
betrayed no signs of any great violence under these circumstances it
is i believe quite impossible to explain the transportal of these
gigantic masses of rock so many miles from their parent-source on any
theory except by that of floating icebergs 

during the two last days we met with signs of horses and with several
small articles which had belonged to the indians such as parts of a
mantle and a bunch of ostrich feathers but they appeared to have
been lying long on the ground between the place where the indians had
so lately crossed the river and this neighbourhood though so many
miles apart the country appears to be quite unfrequented at first 
considering the abundance of the guanacos i was surprised at this but
it is explained by the stony nature of the plains which would soon
disable an unshod horse from taking part in the chase nevertheless 
in two places in this very central region i found small heaps of
stones which i do not think could have been accidentally thrown
together they were placed on points projecting over the edge of the
highest lava cliff and they resembled but on a small scale those
near port desire 

may th captain fitz roy determined to take the boats no higher the
river had a winding course and was very rapid and the appearance of
the country offered no temptation to proceed any further everywhere we
met with the same productions and the same dreary landscape we were
now one hundred and forty miles distant from the atlantic and about
sixty from the nearest arm of the pacific the valley in this upper
part expanded into a wide basin bounded on the north and south by the
basaltic platforms and fronted by the long range of the snow-clad
cordillera but we viewed these grand mountains with regret for we
were obliged to imagine their nature and productions instead of
standing as we had hoped on their summits besides the useless loss
of time which an attempt to ascend the river and higher would have cost
us we had already been for some days on half allowance of bread this 
although really enough for reasonable men was after a hard day s
march rather scanty food a light stomach and an easy digestion are
good things to talk about but very unpleasant in practice 

th before sunrise we commenced our descent we shot down the stream
with great rapidity generally at the rate of ten knots an hour in
this one day we effected what had cost us five-and-a-half hard days 
labour in ascending on the th we reached the beagle after our
twenty-one days expedition every one excepting myself had cause to
be dissatisfied but to me the ascent afforded a most interesting
section of the great tertiary formation of patagonia 

on march st and again on march th the beagle anchored
in berkeley sound in east falkland island this archipelago is
situated in nearly the same latitude with the mouth of the strait of
magellan it covers a space of one hundred and twenty by sixty
geographical miles and is little more than half the size of ireland 
after the possession of these miserable islands had been contested by
france spain and england they were left uninhabited the government
of buenos ayres then sold them to a private individual but likewise
used them as old spain had done before for a penal settlement 
england claimed her right and seized them the englishman who was left
in charge of the flag was consequently murdered a british officer was
next sent unsupported by any power and when we arrived we found him
in charge of a population of which rather more than half were runaway
rebels and murderers 

the theatre is worthy of the scenes acted on it an undulating land 
with a desolate and wretched aspect is everywhere covered by a peaty
soil and wiry grass of one monotonous brown colour here and there a
peak or ridge of grey quartz rock breaks through the smooth surface
every one has heard of the climate of these regions it may be compared
to that which is experienced at the height of between one and two
thousand feet on the mountains of north wales having however less
sunshine and less frost but more wind and rain 

th i will now describe a short excursion which made round a part of
this island in the morning i started with six horses and two gauchos 
the latter were capital men for the purpose and well accustomed to
living on their own resources the weather was very boisterous and
cold with heavy hail-storms we got on however pretty well but 
except the geology nothing could be less interesting than our day s
ride the country is uniformly the same undulating moorland the
surface being covered by light brown withered grass and a few very
small shrubs all springing out of an elastic peaty soil in the
valleys here and there might be seen a small flock of wild geese and
everywhere the ground was so soft that the snipe were able to feed 
besides these two birds there were few others there is one main range
of hills nearly two thousand feet in height and composed of quartz
rock the rugged and barren crests of which gave us some trouble to
cross on the south side we came to the best country for wild cattle 
we met however no great number for they had been lately much
harassed 

in the evening we came across a small herd one of my companions st 
jago by name soon separated a fat cow he threw the bolas and it
struck her legs but failed in becoming entangled then dropping his
hat to mark the spot where the balls were left while at full gallop 
he uncoiled his lazo and after a most severe chase again came up to
the cow and caught her round the horns the other gaucho had gone on
ahead with the spare horses so that st jago had some difficulty in
killing the furious beast he managed to get her on a level piece of
ground by taking advantage of her as often as she rushed at him and
when she would not move my horse from having been trained would
canter up and with his chest give her a violent push but when on
level ground it does not appear an easy job for one man to kill a beast
mad with terror nor would it be so if the horse when left to itself
without its rider did not soon learn for its own safety to keep the
lazo tight so that if the cow or ox moves forward the horse moves
just as quickly forward otherwise it stands motionless leaning on one
side this horse however was a young one and would not stand still 
but gave in to the cow as she struggled it was admirable to see with
what dexterity st jago dodged behind the beast till at last he
contrived to give the fatal touch to the main tendon of the hind leg
after which without much difficulty he drove his knife into the head
of the spinal marrow and the cow dropped as if struck by lightning he
cut off pieces of flesh with the skin to it but without any bones 
sufficient for our expedition we then rode on to our sleeping-place 
and had for supper carne con cuero or meat roasted with the skin on
it this is as superior to common beef as venison is to mutton a
large circular piece taken from the back is roasted on the embers with
the hide downwards and is the form of a saucer so that none of the
gravy is lost if any worthy alderman had supped with us that evening 
 carne con cuero without doubt would soon have been celebrated in
london 

during the night it rained and the next day th was very stormy 
with much hail and snow we rode across the island to the neck of land
which joins the rincon del toro the great peninsula at the s w 
extremity to the rest of the island from the great number of cows
which have been killed there is a large proportion of bulls these
wander about single or two and three together and are very savage i
never saw such magnificent beasts they equalled in the size of their
huge heads and necks the grecian marble sculptures capt sulivan
informs me that the hide of an average-sized bull weighs forty-seven
pounds whereas a hide of this weight less thoroughly dried is
considered as a very heavy one at monte video the young bulls
generally run away for a short distance but the old ones do not stir
a step except to rush at man and horse and many horses have been thus
killed an old bull crossed a boggy stream and took his stand on the
opposite side to us we in vain tried to drive him away and failing 
were obliged to make a large circuit the gauchos in revenge
determined to emasculate him and render him for the future harmless it
was very interesting to see how art completely mastered force one
lazo was thrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse and another
round his hind legs in a minute the monster was stretched powerless on
the ground after the lazo has once been drawn tightly round the horns
of a furious animal it does not at first appear an easy thing to
disengage it again without killing the beast nor i apprehend would
it be so if the man was by himself by the aid however of a second
person throwing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs it is quickly
managed for the animal as long as its hind legs are kept
outstretched is quite helpless and the first man can with his hands
loosen his lazo from the horns and then quietly mount his horse but
the moment the second man by backing ever so little relaxes the
strain the lazo slips off the legs of the struggling beast which then
rises free shakes himself and vainly rushes at his antagonist 

during our whole ride we saw only one troop of wild horses these
animals as well as the cattle were introduced by the french in 
since which time both have greatly increased it is a curious fact 
that the horses have never left the eastern end of the island although
there is no natural boundary to prevent them from roaming and that
part of the island is not more tempting than the rest the gauchos
whom i asked though asserting this to be the case were unable to
account for it except from the strong attachment which horses have to
any locality to which they are accustomed considering that the island
does not appear fully stocked and that there are no beasts of prey i
was particularly curious to know what has checked their originally
rapid increase that in a limited island some check would sooner or
later supervene is inevitable but why had the increase of the horse
been checked sooner than that of the cattle capt sulivan has taken
much pains for me in this inquiry the gauchos employed here attribute
it chiefly to the stallions constantly roaming from place to place and
compelling the mares to accompany them whether or not the young foals
are able to follow one gaucho told capt sulivan that he had watched
a stallion for a whole hour violently kicking and biting a mare till
he forced her to leave her foal to its fate capt sulivan can so far
corroborate this curious account that he has several times found young
foals dead whereas he has never found a dead calf moreover the dead
bodies of full-grown horses are more frequently found as if more
subject to disease or accidents than those of the cattle from the
softness of the ground their hoofs often grow irregularly to a great
length and this causes lameness the predominant colours are roan and
iron-grey all the horses bred here both tame and wild are rather
small-sized though generally in good condition and they have lost so
much strength that they are unfit to be used in taking wild cattle
with the lazo in consequence it is necessary to go to the great
expense of importing fresh horses from the plata at some future
period the southern hemisphere probably will have its breed of falkland
ponies as the northern has its shetland breed 

the cattle instead of having degenerated like the horses seem as
before remarked to have increased in size and they are much more
numerous than the horses capt sulivan informs me that they vary much
less in the general form of their bodies and in the shape of their
horns than english cattle in colour they differ much and it is a
remarkable circumstance that in different parts of this one small
island different colours predominate round mount usborne at a
height of from to feet above the sea about half of some of
the herds are mouse or lead-coloured a tint which is not common in
other parts of the island near port pleasant dark brown prevails 
whereas south of choiseul sound which almost divides the island into
two parts white beasts with black heads and feet are the most common 
in all parts black and some spotted animals may be observed capt 
sulivan remarks that the difference in the prevailing colours was so
obvious that in looking for the herds near port pleasant they
appeared from a long distance like black spots whilst south of
choiseul sound they appeared like white spots on the hill-sides capt 
sulivan thinks that the herds do not mingle and it is a singular fact 
that the mouse-coloured cattle though living on the high land calve
about a month earlier in the season that the other coloured beasts on
the lower land it is interesting thus to find the once domesticated
cattle breaking into three colours of which some one colour would in
all probability ultimately prevail over the others if the herds were
left undisturbed for the next several centuries 

the rabbit is another animal which has been introduced and has
succeeded very well so that they abound over large parts of the
island yet like the horses they are confined within certain limits 
for they have not crossed the central chain of hills nor would they
have extended even so far as its base if as the gauchos informed me 
small colonies has not been carried there i should not have supposed
that these animals natives of northern africa could have existed in a
climate so humid as this and which enjoys so little sunshine that even
wheat ripens only occasionally it is asserted that in sweden which
any one would have thought a more favourable climate the rabbit cannot
live out of doors the first few pairs moreover had here to content
against pre-existing enemies in the fox and some large hawks the
french naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct
species and called it lepus magellanicus they imagined that
magellan when talking of an animal under the name of conejos in the
strait of magellan referred to this species but he was alluding to a
small cavy which to this day is thus called by the spaniards the
gauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being different from the
grey and they said that at all events it had not extended its range
any further than the grey kind that the two were never found separate 
and that they readily bred together and produced piebald offspring of
the latter i now possess a specimen and it is marked about the head
differently from the french specific description this circumstance
shows how cautious naturalists should be in making species for even
cuvier on looking at the skull of one of these rabbits thought it was
probably distinct 

the only quadruped native to the island is a large wolf-like fox
 canis antarcticus which is common to both east and west falkland i
have no doubt it is a peculiar species and confined to this
archipelago because many sealers gauchos and indians who have
visited these islands all maintain that no such animal is found in any
part of south america 

molina from a similarity in habits thought that this was the same
with his culpeu but i have seen both and they are quite
distinct these wolves are well known from byron s account of their
tameness and curiosity which the sailors who ran into the water to
avoid them mistook for fierceness to this day their manners remain
the same they have been observed to enter a tent and actually pull
some meat from beneath the head of a sleeping seaman the gauchos also
have frequently in the evening killed them by holding out a piece of
meat in one hand and in the other a knife ready to stick them as far
as i am aware there is no other instance in any part of the world of
so small a mass of broken land distant from a continent possessing so
large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself their numbers have
rapidly decreased they are already banished from that half of the
island which lies to the eastward of the neck of land between st 
salvador bay and berkeley sound within a very few years after these
islands shall have become regularly settled in all probability this
for will be classed with the dodo as an animal which has perished from
the face of the earth 

at night th we slept on the neck of land at the head of choiseul
sound which forms the south-west peninsula the valley was pretty well
sheltered from the cold wind but there was very little brushwood for
fuel the gauchos however soon found what to my great surprise 
made nearly as hot a fire as coals this was the skeleton of a bullock
lately killed from which the flesh had been picked by the
carrion-hawks they told me that in winter they often killed a beast 
cleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives and then with these
same bones roasted the meat for their suppers 

th it rained during nearly the whole day at night we managed 
however with our saddle-cloths to keep ourselves pretty well dry and
warm but the ground on which we slept was on each occasion nearly in
the state of a bog and there was not a dry spot to sit down on after
our day s ride i have in another part stated how singular it is that
there should be absolutely no trees on these islands although tierra
del fuego is covered by one large forest the largest bush in the
island belonging to the family of compositae is scarcely so tall as
our gorse the best fuel is afforded by a green little bush about the
size of common heath which has the useful property of burning while
fresh and green it was very surprising to see the gauchos in the
midst of rain and everything soaking wet with nothing more than a
tinder-box and a piece of rag immediately make a fire they sought
beneath the tufts of grass and bushel for a few dry twigs and these
they rubbed into fibres then surrounding them with coarser twigs 
something like a bird s nest they put the rag with its spark of fire
in the middle and covered it up the nest being then held up to the
wind by degrees it smoked more and more and at last burst out in
flames i do not think any other method would have had a chance of
succeeding with such damp materials 

th each morning from not having ridden for some time previously i
was very stiff i was surprised to hear the gauchos who have from
infancy almost lived on horseback say that under similar
circumstances they always suffer st jago told me that having been
confined for three months by illness he went out hunting wild cattle 
and in consequence for the next two days his thighs were so stiff
that he was obliged to lie in bed this shows that the gauchos 
although they do not appear to do so yet really must exert much
muscular effort in riding the hunting wild cattle in a country so
difficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground must be
very hard work the gauchos say they often pass at full speed over
ground which would be impassable at a slower pace in the same manner
as a man is able to skate over thin ice when hunting the party
endeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being
discovered each man carries four or five pair of the bolas these he
throws one after the other at as many cattle which when once
entangled are left for some days till they become a little exhausted
by hunger and struggling they are then let free and driven towards a
small herd of tame animals which have been brought to the spot on
purpose from their previous treatment being too much terrified to
leave the herd they are easily driven if their strength last out to
the settlement 

the weather continued so very bad that we determine to make a push and
try to reach the vessel before night from the quantity of rain which
had fallen the surface of the whole country was swampy i suppose my
horse fell at least a dozen times and sometimes the whole six horses
were floundering in the mud together all the little streams are
bordered by soft peat which makes it very difficult for the horses to
leap them without falling to complete our discomforts we were obliged
to cross the head of a creek of the sea in which the water was as high
as our horses backs and the little waves owing to the violence of
the wind broke over us and made us very wet and cold even the
iron-framed gauchos professed themselves glad when they reached the
settlement after our little excursion 

the geological structure of these islands is in most respects simple 
the lower country consists of clay-slate and sandstone containing
fossils very closely related to but not identical with those found
in the silurian formations of europe the hills are formed of white
granular quartz rock the strata of the latter are frequently arched
with perfect symmetry and the appearance of some of the masses is in
consequence most singular pernety has devoted several pages to
the description of a hill of ruins the successive strata of which he
has justly compared to the seats of an amphitheatre the quartz rock
must have been quite pasty when it underwent such remarkable flexures
without being shattered into fragments as the quartz insensibly
passes into the sandstone it seems probable that the former owes its
origin to the sandstone having been heated to such a degree that it
became viscid and upon cooling crystallized while in the soft state
it must have been pushed up through the overlying beds 

in many parts of the island the bottoms of the valleys are covered in
an extraordinary manner by myriads of great loose angular fragments of
the quartz rock forming streams of stones these have been mentioned
with surprise by every voyager since the time of pernety the blocks
are not water-worn their angles being only a little blunted they vary
in size from one or two feet in diameter to ten or even more than
twenty times as much they are not thrown together into irregular
piles but are spread out into level sheets or great streams it is
not possible to ascertain their thickness but the water of small
streamlets can be heard trickling through the stones many feet below
the surface the actual depth is probably great because the crevices
between the lower fragments must long ago have been filled up with
sand the width of these sheets of stones varied from a few hundred
feet to a mile but the peaty soil daily encroaches on the borders and
even forms islets wherever a few fragments happen to lie close
together in a valley south of berkeley sound which some of our party
called the great valley of fragments it was necessary to cross an
uninterrupted band half a mile wide by jumping from one pointed stone
to another so large were the fragments that being overtaken by a
shower of rain i readily found shelter beneath one of them 

their little inclination is the most remarkable circumstance in these
 streams of stones on the hill-sides i have seen them sloping at an
angle of ten degrees with the horizon but in some of the level 
broad-bottomed valleys the inclination is only just sufficient to be
clearly perceived on so rugged a surface there was no means of
measuring the angle but to give a common illustration i may say that
the slope would not have checked the speed of an english mail-coach in
some places a continuous stream of these fragments followed up the
course of a valley and even extended to the very crest of the hill on
these crests huge masses exceeding in dimensions any small building 
seemed to stand arrested in their headlong course there also the
curved strata of the archways lay piled on each other like the ruins
of some vast and ancient cathedral in endeavouring to describe these
scenes of violence one is tempted to pass from one simile to another 
we may imagine that streams of white lava had flowed from many parts of
the mountains into the lower country and that when solidified they had
been rent by some enormous convulsion into myriads of fragments the
expression streams of stones which immediately occurred to every
one conveys the same idea these scenes are on the spot rendered more
striking by the contrast of the low rounded forms of the neighbouring
hills 

i was interested by finding on the highest peak of one range about 
feet above the sea a great arched fragment lying on its convex side 
or back downwards must we believe that it was fairly pitched up in
the air and thus turned or with more probability that there
existed formerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point
on which this monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies as
the fragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices
filled up with sand we must infer that the period of violence was
subsequent to the land having been raised above the waters of the sea 
in a transverse section within these valleys the bottom is nearly
level or rises but very little towards either side hence the
fragments appear to have travelled from the head of the valley but in
reality it seems more probable that they have been hurled down from the
nearest slopes and that since by a vibratory movement of overwhelming
force the fragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet 
if during the earthquake which in overthrew concepcion in
chile it was thought wonderful that small bodies should have been
pitched a few inches from the ground what must we say to a movement
which has caused fragments many tons in weight to move onwards like so
much sand on a vibrating board and find their level i have seen in
the cordillera of the andes the evident marks where stupendous
mountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust and the
strata thrown of their vertical edges but never did any scene like
these streams of stones so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a
convulsion of which in historical records we might in vain seek for
any counterpart yet the progress of knowledge will probably some day
give a simple explanation of this phenomenon as it already has of the
so long-thought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders which
are strewed over the plains of europe 

i have little to remark on the zoology of these islands have before
described the carrion-vulture of polyborus there are some other hawks 
owls and a few small land-birds the water-fowl are particularly
numerous and they must formerly from the accounts of the old
navigators have been much more so one day i observed a cormorant
playing with a fish which it had caught eight times successively the
bird let its prey go then dived after it and although in deep water 
brought it each time to the surface in the zoological gardens i have
seen the otter treat a fish in the same manner much as a cat does a
mouse i do not know of any other instance where dame nature appears so
wilfully cruel another day having placed myself between a penguin
 aptenodytes demersa and the water i was much amused by watching its
habits it was a brave bird and till reaching the sea it regularly
fought and drove me backwards nothing less than heavy blows would have
stopped him every inch he gained he firmly kept standing close before
me erect and determined when thus opposed he continually rolled his
head from side to side in a very odd manner as if the power of
distinct vision lay only in the anterior and basal part of each eye 
this bird is commonly called the jackass penguin from its habit while
on shore of throwing its head backwards and making a loud strange
noise very like the braying of an ass but while at sea and
undisturbed its note is very deep and solemn and is often heard in
the night-time in diving its little wings are used as fins but on
the land as front legs when crawling it may be said on four legs 
through the tussocks or on the side of a grassy cliff it moves so very
quickly that it might easily be mistaken for a quadruped when at sea
and fishing it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with
such a spring and dives again so instantaneously that i defy any one
at first sight to be sure that it was not a fish leaping for sport 

two kinds of geese frequent the falklands the upland species anas
magellanica is common in pairs and in small flocks throughout the
island they do not migrate but build on the small outlying islets 
this is supposed to be from fear of the foxes and it is perhaps from
the same cause that these birds though very tame by day are shy and
wild in the dusk of the evening they live entirely on vegetable
matter 

the rock-goose so called from living exclusively on the sea-beach
 anas antarctica is common both here and on the west coast of
america as far north as chile in the deep and retired channels of
tierra del fuego the snow-white gander invariably accompanied by his
darker consort and standing close by each other on some distant rocky
point is a common feature in the landscape 

in these islands a great loggerheaded duck or goose anas brachyptera 
which sometimes weighs twenty-two pounds is very abundant these
birds were in former days called from their extraordinary manner of
paddling and splashing upon the water race-horses but now they are
named much more appropriately steamers their wings are too small
and weak to allow of flight but by their aid partly swimming and
partly flapping the surface of the water they move very quickly the
manner is something like that by which the common house-duck escapes
when pursued by a dog but i am nearly sure that the steamer moves its
wings alternately instead of both together as in other birds these
clumsy loggerheaded ducks make such a noise and splashing that the
effect is exceedingly curious 

thus we find in south america three birds which use their wings for
other purposes besides flight the penguins as fins the steamer as
paddles and the ostrich as sails and the apteryz of new zealand as
well as its gigantic extinct prototype the deinornis possess only
rudimentary representatives of wings the steamer is able to dive only
to a very short distance it feeds entirely on shell-fish from the
kelp and tidal rocks hence the beak and head for the purpose of
breaking them are surprisingly heavy and strong the head is so strong
that i have scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological
hammer and all our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds
were of life when in the evening pluming themselves in a flock they
make the same odd mixture of sounds which bull-frogs do within the
tropics 

in tierra del fuego as well as in the falkland islands made many
observations on the lower marine animals but they are of little
general interest i will mention only one class of facts relating to
certain zoophytes in the more highly organized division of that class 
several genera flustra eschara cellaria crisia and others agree
in having singular moveable organs like those of flustra avicularia 
found in the european seas attached to their cells the organ in the
greater number of cases very closely resembles the head of a vulture 
but the lower mandible can be opened much wider than in a real bird s
beak the head itself possessed considerable powers of movement by
means of a short neck in one zoophyte the head itself was fixed but
the lower jaw free in another it was replaced by a triangular hood 
with beautifully-fitted trap-door which evidently answered to the
lower mandible in the greater number of species each cell was
provided with one head but in others each cell had two 

the young cells at the end of the branches of these corallines contain
quite immature polypi yet the vulture-head attached to them though
small are in every respect perfect when the polypus was removed by a
needle from any of the cells these organs did not appear in the least
affected when one of the vulture-like heads was cut off from the
cell the lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing 
perhaps the most singular part of their structure is that when there
were more than two rows of cells on a branch the central cells were
furnished with these appendages of only one-fourth the size of the
outside ones their movements varied according to the species but in
some i never saw the least motion while others with the lower
mandible generally wide open oscillated backwards and forwards at the
rate of about five seconds each turn others moved rapidly and by
starts when touched with a needle the beak generally seized the
point so firmly that the whole branch might be shaken 

these bodies have no relation whatever with the production of the eggs
or gemmules as they are formed before the young polypi appear in the
cells at the end of the growing branches as they move independently of
the polypi and do not appear to be in any way connected with them and
as they differ in size on the outer and inner rows of cells i have
little doubt that in their functions they are related rather to the
horny axis of the branches than to the polypi in the cells the fleshy
appendage at the lower extremity of the sea-pen described at bahia
blanca also forms part of the zoophyte as a whole in the same manner
as the roots of a tree form part of the whole tree and not of the
individual leaf or flower-buds 

in another elegant little coralline crisia each cell was furnished
with a long-toothed bristle which had the power of moving quickly 
each of these bristles and each of the vulture-like heads generally
moved quite independently of the others but sometimes all on both
sides of a branch sometimes only those on one side moved together
coinstantaneously sometimes each moved in regular order one after
another in these actions we apparently behold as perfect a
transmission of will in the zoophyte though composed of thousands of
distinct polypi as in any single animal the case indeed is not
different from that of the sea-pens which when touched drew
themselves into the sand on the coast of bahia blanca i will state
one other instance of uniform action though of a very different
nature in a zoophyte closely allied to clytia and therefore very
simply organized having kept a large tuft of it in a basin of
salt-water when it was dark i found that as often as i rubbed any part
of a branch the whole became strongly phosphorescent with a green
light i do not think i ever saw any object more beautifully so but
the remarkable circumstance was that the flashes of light always
proceeded up the branches from the base towards the extremities 

the examination of these compound animals was always very interesting
to me what can be more remarkable that to see a plant-like body
producing an egg capable of swimming about and of choosing a proper
place to adhere to which then sprouts into branches each crowded with
innumerable distinct animals often of complicated organizations the
branches moreover as we have just seen sometimes possess organs
capable of movement and independent of the polypi surprising as this
union of separate individuals in common stock must always appear every
tree displays the same fact for buds must be considered as individual
plants it is however natural to consider a polypus furnished with a
mouth intestines and other organs as a distinct individual whereas
the individuality of a leaf-bud is not easily realised so that the
union of separate individuals in a common body is more striking in a
coralline than in a tree our conception of a compound animal where
in some respects the individuality of each is not completed may be
aided by reflecting on the production of two distinct creatures by
bisecting a single one with a knife or where nature herself performs
the task of bisection we may consider the polypi in a zoophyte or
the buds in a tree as cases where the division of the individual has
not been completely effected certainly in the case of trees and
judging from analogy in that of corallines the individuals propagated
by buds seem more intimately related to each other than eggs or seeds
are to their parents it seems now pretty well established that plants
propagated by buds all partake of a common duration of life and it is
familiar to every one what singular and numerous peculiarities are
transmitted with certainty by buds layers and grafts which by
seminal propagation never or only casually reappear

 london s magazine of nat hist vol vii 

 from accounts published since our voyage and more especially from
several interesting letters from capt sulivan r n employed on the
survey it appears that we took an exaggerated view of the badness of
the climate on these islands but when i reflect on the almost
universal covering of peat and on the fact of wheat seldom ripening
here i can hardly believe that the climate in summer is so fine and
dry as it has lately been represented 

 lesson s zoology of the voyage of the coquille tom i p all
the early voyagers and especially bougainville distinctly state that
the wolf-like fox was the only native animal on the island the
distinction of the rabbit as a species is taken from peculiarities in
the fur from the shape of the head and from the shortness of the
ears i may here observe that the difference between the irish and
english hare rests upon nearly similar characters only more strongly
marked 

 i have reason however to suspect that there is a field-mouse the
common european rat and mouse have roamed far from the habitations of
the settlers the common hog has also run wild on one islet all are
of a black colour the boars are very fierce and have great trunks

 an inhabitant of mendoza and hence well capable of judging 
assured me that during the several years he had resided on these
islands he had never felt the slightest shock of an earthquake 

 i was surprised to find on counting the eggs of a large white
doris this sea-slug was three and a half inches long how
extraordinarily numerous they were from two to five eggs each
three-thousandths of an inch in diameter were contained in spherical
little case these were arranged two deep in transverse rows forming a
ribbon the ribbon adhered by its edge to the rock in an oval spire 
one which i found measured nearly twenty inches in length and half in
breadth by counting how many balls were contained in a tenth of an
inch in the row and how many rows in an equal length of the ribbon on
the most moderate computation there were six hundred thousand eggs yet
this doris was certainly not very common although i was often
searching under the stones i saw only seven individuals no fallacy
is more common with naturalists than that the numbers of an individual
species depend on its powers of propagation

tierra del fuego

tierra del fuego first arrival good success bay an account of the
fuegians on board interview with the savages scenery of the
forests cape horn wigwam cove miserable condition of the
savages famines cannibals matricide religious feelings great
gale beagle channel ponsonby sound build wigwams and settle the
fuegians bifurcation of the beagle channel glaciers return to the
ship second visit in the ship to the settlement equality of condition
amongst the natives 


december th having now finished with patagonia and the
falkland islands i will describe our first arrival in tierra del
fuego a little after noon we doubled cape st diego and entered the
famous strait of le maire we kept close to the fuegian shore but the
outline of the rugged inhospitable statenland was visible amidst the
clouds in the afternoon we anchored in the bay of good success while
entering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this
savage land a group of fuegians partly concealed by the entangled
forest were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea and as we
passed by they sprang up and waving their tattered cloaks sent forth a
loud and sonorous shout the savages followed the ship and just
before dark we saw their fire and again heard their wild cry the
harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low
rounded mountains of clay-slate which are covered to the water s edge
by one dense gloomy forest a single glance at the landscape was
sufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything i had
ever beheld at night it blew a gale of wind and heavy squalls from
the mountains swept past us it would have been a bad time out at sea 
and we as well as others may call this good success bay 

in the morning the captain sent a party to communicate with the
fuegians when we came within hail one of the four natives who were
present advanced to receive us and began to shout most vehemently 
wishing to direct us where to land when we were on shore the party
looked rather alarmed but continued talking and making gestures with
great rapidity it was without exception the most curious and
interesting spectacle i ever beheld i could not have believed how wide
was the difference between savage and civilized man it is greater than
between a wild and domesticated animal inasmuch as in man there is a
greater power of improvement the chief spokesman was old and
appeared to be the head of the family the three others were powerful
young men about six feet high the women and children had been sent
away these fuegians are a very different race from the stunted 
miserable wretches farther westward and they seem closely allied to
the famous patagonians of the strait of magellan their only garment
consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin with the wool outside this
they wear just thrown over their shoulders leaving their persons as
often exposed as covered their skin is of a dirty coppery-red colour 

the old man had a fillet of white feathers tied round his head which
partly confined his black coarse and entangled hair his face was
crossed by two broad transverse bars one painted bright red reached
from ear to ear and included the upper lip the other white like
chalk extended above and parallel to the first so that even his
eyelids were thus coloured the other two men were ornamented by
streaks of black powder made of charcoal the party altogether
closely resembled the devils which come on the stage in plays like der
freischutz 

their very attitudes were abject and the expression of their
countenances distrustful surprised and startled after we had
presented them with some scarlet cloth which they immediately tied
round their necks they became good friends this was shown by the old
man patting our breasts and making a chuckling kind of noise as
people do when feeding chickens i walked with the old man and this
demonstration of friendship was repeated several times it was
concluded by three hard slaps which were given me on the breast and
back at the same time he then bared his bosom for me to return the
compliment which being done he seemed highly pleased the language
of these people according to our notions scarcely deserves to be
called articulate captain cook has compared it to a man clearing his
throat but certainly no european ever cleared his throat with so many
hoarse guttural and clicking sounds 

they are excellent mimics as often as we coughed or yawned or made
any odd motion they immediately imitated us some of our party began
to squint and look awry but one of the young fuegians whose whole
face was painted black excepting a white band across his eyes 
succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces they could repeat with
perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them and
they remembered such words for some time yet we europeans all know
how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign
language which of us for instance could follow an american indian
through a sentence of more than three words all savages appear to
possess to an uncommon degree this power of mimicry i was told 
almost in the same words of the same ludicrous habit among the
caffres the australians likewise have long been notorious for being
able to imitate and describe the gait of any man so that he may be
recognized how can this faculty be explained is it a consequence of
the more practised habits of perception and keener senses common to
all men in a savage state as compared with those long civilized 

when a song was struck up by our party i thought the fuegians would
have fallen down with astonishment with equal surprise they viewed
our dancing but one of the young men when asked had no objection to
a little waltzing little accustomed to europeans as they appeared to
be yet they knew and dreaded our fire-arms nothing would tempt them
to take a gun in their hands they begged for knives calling them by
the spanish word cuchilla they explained also what they wanted by
acting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth and then
pretending to cut instead of tear it 

i have not as yet noticed the fuegians whom we had on board during
the former voyage of the adventure and beagle in to captain
fitz roy seized on a party of natives as hostages for the loss of a
boat which had been stolen to the great jeopardy of a party employed
on the survey and some of these natives as well as a child whom he
bought for a pearl-button he took with him to england determining to
educate them and instruct them in religion at his own expense to
settle these natives in their own country was one chief inducement to
captain fitz roy to undertake our present voyage and before the
admiralty had resolved to send out this expedition captain fitz roy
had generously chartered a vessel and would himself have taken them
back the natives were accompanied by a missionary r matthews of
whom and of the natives captain fitz roy has published a full and
excellent account two men one of whom died in england of the
small-pox a boy and a little girl were originally taken and we had
now on board york minster jemmy button whose name expresses his
purchase-money and fuegia basket york minster was a full-grown 
short thick powerful man his disposition was reserved taciturn 
morose and when excited violently passionate his affections were very
strong towards a few friends on board his intellect good jemmy
button was a universal favourite but likewise passionate the
expression of his face at once showed his nice disposition he was
merry and often laughed and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in
pain when the water was rough i was often a little sea-sick and he
used to come to me and say in a plaintive voice poor poor fellow 
but the notion after his aquatic life of a man being sea-sick was
too ludicrous and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide
a smile or laugh and then he would repeat his poor poor fellow he
was of a patriotic disposition and he liked to praise his own tribe
and country in which he truly said there were plenty of trees and
he abused all the other tribes he stoutly declared that there was no
devil in his land jemmy was short thick and fat but vain of his
personal appearance he used always to wear gloves his hair was neatly
cut and he was distressed if his well-polished shoes were dirtied he
was fond of admiring himself in a looking glass and a merry-faced
little indian boy from the rio negro whom we had for some months on
board soon perceived this and used to mock him jemmy who was always
rather jealous of the attention paid to this little boy did not at all
like this and used to say with rather a contemptuous twist of his
head too much skylark it seems yet wonderful to me when i think
over all his many good qualities that he should have been of the same
race and doubtless partaken of the same character with the miserable 
degraded savages whom we first met here lastly fuegia basket was a
nice modest reserved young girl with a rather pleasing but sometimes
sullen expression and very quick in learning anything especially
languages this she showed in picking up some portuguese and spanish 
when left on shore for only a short time at rio de janeiro and monte
video and in her knowledge of english york minster was very jealous
of any attention paid to her for it was clear he determined to marry
her as soon as they were settled on shore 

although all three could both speak and understand a good deal of
english it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from
them concerning the habits of their countrymen this was partly owing
to their apparent difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative 
every one accustomed to very young children knows how seldom one can
get an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black
or white the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their
minds so it was with these fuegians and hence it was generally
impossible to find out by cross questioning whether one had rightly
understood anything which they had asserted their sight was
remarkably acute it is well known that sailors from long practice 
can make out a distant object much better than a landsman but both
york and jemmy were much superior to any sailor on board several times
they have declared what some distant object has been and though
doubted by every one they have proved right when it has been examined
through a telescope they were quite conscious of this power and
jemmy when he had any little quarrel with the officer on watch would
say me see ship me no tell 

it was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages when we landed 
towards jemmy button they immediately perceived the difference between
him and ourselves and held much conversation one with another on the
subject the old man addressed a long harangue to jemmy which it
seems was to invite him to stay with them but jemmy understood very
little of their language and was moreover thoroughly ashamed of his
countrymen when york minster afterwards came on shore they noticed
him in the same way and told him he ought to shave yet he had not
twenty dwarf hairs on his face whilst we all wore our untrimmed
beards they examined the colour of his skin and compared it with
ours one of our arms being bared they expressed the liveliest
surprise and admiration at its whiteness just in the same way in which
i have seen the ourangoutang do at the zoological gardens we thought
that they mistook two or three of the officers who were rather shorter
and fairer though adorned with large beards for the ladies of our
party the tallest amongst the fuegians was evidently much pleased at
his height being noticed when placed back to back with the tallest of
the boat s crew he tried his best to edge on higher ground and to
stand on tiptoe he opened his mouth to show his teeth and turned his
face for a side view and all this was done with such alacrity that i
dare say he thought himself the handsomest man in tierra del fuego 
after our first feeling of grave astonishment was over nothing could
be more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which
these savages every moment exhibited 


the next day i attempted to penetrate some way into the country tierra
del fuego may be described as a mountainous land partly submerged in
the sea so that deep inlets and bays occupy the place where valleys
should exist the mountain sides except on the exposed western coast 
are covered from the water s edge upwards by one great forest the
trees reach to an elevation of between and feet and are
succeeded by a band of peat with minute alpine plants and this again
is succeeded by the line of perpetual snow which according to captain
king in the strait of magellan descends to between and feet 
to find an acre of level land in any part of the country is most rare 
i recollect only one little flat piece near port famine and another of
rather larger extent near goeree road in both places and everywhere
else the surface is covered by a thick bed of swampy peat even within
the forest the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly putrefying
vegetable matter which from being soaked with water yields to the
foot 

finding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood i followed
the course of a mountain torrent at first from the waterfalls and
number of dead trees i could hardly crawl along but the bed of the
stream soon became a little more open from the floods having swept the
sides i continued slowly to advance for an hour along the broken and
rocky banks and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene the
gloomy depth of the ravine well accorded with the universal signs of
violence on every side were lying irregular masses of rock and
torn-up trees other trees though still erect were decayed to the
heart and ready to fall the entangled mass of the thriving and the
fallen reminded me of the forests within the tropics yet there was a
difference for in these still solitudes death instead of life 
seemed the predominant spirit i followed the water-course till i came
to a spot where a great slip had cleared a straight space down the
mountain side by this road i ascended to a considerable elevation 
and obtained a good view of the surrounding woods the trees all
belong to one kind the fagus betuloides for the number of the other
species of fagus and of the winter s bark is quite inconsiderable 
this beech keeps its leaves throughout the year but its foliage is of
a peculiar brownish-green colour with a tinge of yellow as the whole
landscape is thus coloured it has a sombre dull appearance nor is it
often enlivened by the rays of the sun 

december th one side of the harbour is formed by a hill about 
feet high which captain fitz roy has called after sir j banks in
commemoration of his disastrous excursion which proved fatal to two
men of his party and nearly so to dr solander the snow-storm which
was the cause of their misfortune happened in the middle of january 
corresponding to our july and in the latitude of durham i was anxious
to reach the summit of this mountain to collect alpine plants for
flowers of any kind in the lower parts are few in number we followed
the same water-course as on the previous day till it dwindled away 
and we were then compelled to crawl blindly among the trees these 
from the effects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds were low 
thick and crooked at length we reached that which from a distance
appeared like a carpet of fine green turf but which to our vexation 
turned out to be a compact mass of little beech-trees about four or
five feet high they were as thick together as box in the border of a
garden and we were obliged to struggle over the flat but treacherous
surface after a little more trouble we gained the peat and then the
bare slate rock 

a ridge connected this hill with another distant some miles and more
lofty so that patches of snow were lying on it as the day was not
far advanced i determined to walk there and collect plants along the
road it would have been very hard work had it not been for a
well-beaten and straight path made by the guanacos for these animals 
like sheep always follow the same line when we reached the hill we
found it the highest in the immediate neighbourhood and the waters
flowed to the sea in opposite directions we obtained a wide view over
the surrounding country to the north a swampy moorland extended but
to the south we had a scene of savage magnificence well becoming
tierra del fuego there was a degree of mysterious grandeur in
mountain behind mountain with the deep intervening valleys all
covered by one thick dusky mass of forest the atmosphere likewise 
in this climate where gale succeeds gale with rain hail and sleet 
seems blacker than anywhere else in the strait of magellan looking
due southward from port famine the distant channels between the
mountains appeared from their gloominess to lead beyond the confines of
this world 

december st the beagle got under way and on the succeeding day 
favoured to an uncommon degree by a fine easterly breeze we closed in
with the barnevelts and running past cape deceit with its stony peaks 
about three o clock doubled the weather-beaten cape horn the evening
was calm and bright and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding
isles cape horn however demanded his tribute and before night sent
us a gale of wind directly in our teeth we stood out to sea and on
the second day again made the land when we saw on our weather-bow this
notorious promontory in its proper form veiled in a mist and its dim
outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water great black clouds
were rolling across the heavens and squalls of rain with hail swept
by us with such extreme violence that the captain determined to run
into wigwam cove this is a snug little harbour not far from cape
horn and here at christmas-eve we anchored in smooth water the
only thing which reminded us of the gale outside was every now and
then a puff from the mountains which made the ship surge at her
anchors 

december th close by the cove a pointed hill called kater s peak 
rises to the height of feet the surrounding islands all consist
of conical masses of greenstone associated sometimes with less regular
hills of baked and altered clay-slate this part of tierra del fuego
may be considered as the extremity of the submerged chain of mountains
already alluded to the cove takes its name of wigwam from some of
the fuegian habitations but every bay in the neighbourhood might be so
called with equal propriety the inhabitants living chiefly upon
shell-fish are obliged constantly to change their place of residence 
but they return at intervals to the same spots as is evident from the
piles of old shells which must often amount to many tons in freight 
these heaps can be distinguished at a long distance by the bright green
colour of certain plants which invariably grow on them among these
may be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass two very
serviceable plants the use of which has not been discovered by the
natives 

the fuegian wigwam resembles in size and dimensions a haycock it
merely consists of a few broken branches stuck in the ground and very
imperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes 
the whole cannot be the work of an hour and it is only used for a few
days at goeree roads i saw a place where one of these naked men had
slept which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare 
the man was evidently living by himself and york minster said he was
 very bad man and that probably he had stolen something on the west
coast however the wigwams are rather better for they are covered
with seal-skins we were detained here several days by the bad
weather the climate is certainly wretched the summer solstice was
now passed yet every day snow fell on the hills and in the valleys
there was rain accompanied by sleet the thermometer generally stood
about degs but in the night fell to or degs from the damp
and boisterous state of the atmosphere not cheered by a gleam of
sunshine one fancied the climate even worse than it really was 

while going one day on shore near wollaston island we pulled alongside
a canoe with six fuegians these were the most abject and miserable
creatures i anywhere beheld on the east coast the natives as we have
seen have guanaco cloaks and on the west they possess seal-skins 
amongst these central tribes the men generally have an otter-skin or
some small scrap about as large as a pocket-handkerchief which is
barely sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their loins it
is laced across the breast by strings and according as the wind blows 
it is shifted from side to side but these fuegians in the canoe were
quite naked and even one full-grown woman was absolutely so it was
raining heavily and the fresh water together with the spray trickled
down her body in another harbour not far distant a woman who was
suckling a recently-born child came one day alongside the vessel and
remained there out of mere curiosity whilst the sleet fell and thawed
on her naked bosom and on the skin of her naked baby these poor
wretches were stunted in their growth their hideous faces bedaubed
with white paint their skins filthy and greasy their hair entangled 
their voices discordant and their gestures violent viewing such men 
one can hardly make one s self believe that they are fellow-creatures 
and inhabitants of the same world it is a common subject of
conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower animals can enjoy 
how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to
these barbarians at night five or six human beings naked and
scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate 
sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals whenever it is low
water winter or summer night or day they must rise to pick
shell-fish from the rocks and the women either dive to collect
sea-eggs or sit patiently in their canoes and with a baited hair-line
without any hook jerk out little fish if a seal is killed or the
floating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered it is a feast and
such miserable food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and fungi 

they often suffer from famine i heard mr low a sealing-master
intimately acquainted with the natives of this country give a curious
account of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the
west coast who were very thin and in great distress a succession of
gales prevented the women from getting shell-fish on the rocks and
they could not go out in their canoes to catch seal a small party of
these men one morning set out and the other indians explained to him 
that they were going a four days journey for food on their return 
low went to meet them and he found them excessively tired each man
carrying a great square piece of putrid whale s-blubber with a hole in
the middle through which they put their heads like the gauchos do
through their ponchos or cloaks as soon as the blubber was brought
into a wigwam an old man cut off thin slices and muttering over them 
broiled them for a minute and distributed them to the famished party 
who during this time preserved a profound silence mr low believes
that whenever a whale is cast on shore the natives bury large pieces
of it in the sand as a resource in time of famine and a native boy 
whom he had on board once found a stock thus buried the different
tribes when at war are cannibals from the concurrent but quite
independent evidence of the boy taken by mr low and of jemmy button 
it is certainly true that when pressed in winter by hunger they kill
and devour their old women before they kill their dogs the boy being
asked by mr low why they did this answered doggies catch otters 
old women no this boy described the manner in which they are killed
by being held over smoke and thus choked he imitated their screams as
a joke and described the parts of their bodies which are considered
best to eat horrid as such a death by the hands of their friends and
relatives must be the fears of the old women when hunger begins to
press are more painful to think of we are told that they then often
run away into the mountains but that they are pursued by the men and
brought back to the slaughter-house at their own firesides 

captain fitz roy could never ascertain that the fuegians have any
distinct belief in a future life they sometimes bury their dead in
caves and sometimes in the mountain forests we do not know what
ceremonies they perform jemmy button would not eat land-birds because
 eat dead men they are unwilling even to mention their dead friends 
we have no reason to believe that they perform any sort of religious
worship though perhaps the muttering of the old man before he
distributed the putrid blubber to his famished party may be of this
nature each family or tribe has a wizard or conjuring doctor whose
office we could never clearly ascertain jemmy believed in dreams 
though not as i have said in the devil i do not think that our
fuegians were much more superstitious than some of the sailors for an
old quartermaster firmly believed that the successive heavy gales 
which we encountered off cape horn were caused by our having the
fuegians on board the nearest approach to a religious feeling which i
heard of was shown by york minster who when mr bynoe shot some very
young ducklings as specimens declared in the most solemn manner oh 
mr bynoe much rain snow blow much this was evidently a
retributive punishment for wasting human food in a wild and excited
manner he also related that his brother one day whilst returning to
pick up some dead birds which he had left on the coast observed some
feathers blown by the wind his brother said york imitating his
manner what that and crawling onwards he peeped over the cliff 
and saw wild man picking his birds he crawled a little nearer and
then hurled down a great stone and killed him york declared for a
long time afterwards storms raged and much rain and snow fell as far
as we could make out he seemed to consider the elements themselves as
the avenging agents it is evident in this case how naturally in a
race a little more advanced in culture the elements would become
personified what the bad wild men were has always appeared to me
most mysterious from what york said when we found the place like the
form of a hare where a single man had slept the night before i should
have thought that they were thieves who had been driven from their
tribes but other obscure speeches made me doubt this i have sometimes
imagined that the most probable explanation was that they were insane 

the different tribes have no government or chief yet each is
surrounded by other hostile tribes speaking different dialects and
separated from each other only by a deserted border or neutral
territory the cause of their warfare appears to be the means of
subsistence their country is a broken mass of wild rocks lofty
hills and useless forests and these are viewed through mists and
endless storms the habitable land is reduced to the stones on the
beach in search of food they are compelled unceasingly to wander from
spot to spot and so steep is the coast that they can only move about
in their wretched canoes they cannot know the feeling of having a
home and still less that of domestic affection for the husband is to
the wife a brutal master to a laborious slave was a more horrid deed
ever perpetrated than that witnessed on the west coast by byron who
saw a wretched mother pick up her bleeding dying infant-boy whom her
husband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket of
sea-eggs how little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into
play what is there for imagination to picture for reason to compare 
or judgment to decide upon to knock a limpet from the rock does not
require even cunning that lowest power of the mind their skill in
some respects may be compared to the instinct of animals for it is not
improved by experience the canoe their most ingenious work poor as
it is has remained the same as we know from drake for the last two
hundred and fifty years 

whilst beholding these savages one asks whence have they come what
could have tempted or what change compelled a tribe of men to leave
the fine regions of the north to travel down the cordillera or
backbone of america to invent and build canoes which are not used by
the tribes of chile peru and brazil and then to enter on one of the
most inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe although
such reflections must at first seize on the mind yet we may feel sure
that they are partly erroneous there is no reason to believe that the
fuegians decrease in number therefore we must suppose that they enjoy
a sufficient share of happiness of whatever kind it may be to render
life worth having nature by making habit omnipotent and its effects
hereditary has fitted the fuegian to the climate and the productions
of his miserable country 


after having been detained six days in wigwam cove by very bad weather 
we put to sea on the th of december captain fitz roy wished to get
westward to land york and fuegia in their own country when at sea we
had a constant succession of gales and the current was against us we
drifted to degs south on the th of january by
carrying a press of sail we fetched within a few miles of the great
rugged mountain of york minster so called by captain cook and the
origin of the name of the elder fuegian when a violent squall
compelled us to shorten sail and stand out to sea the surf was
breaking fearfully on the coast and the spray was carried over a cliff
estimated to feet in height on the th the gale was very heavy 
and we did not know exactly where we were it was a most unpleasant
sound to hear constantly repeated keep a good look-out to leeward 
on the th the storm raged with its full fury our horizon was
narrowly limited by the sheets of spray borne by the wind the sea
looked ominous like a dreary waving plain with patches of drifted
snow whilst the ship laboured heavily the albatross glided with its
expanded wings right up the wind at noon a great sea broke over us 
and filled one of the whale boats which was obliged to be instantly
cut away the poor beagle trembled at the shock and for a few minutes
would not obey her helm but soon like a good ship that she was she
righted and came up to the wind again had another sea followed the
first our fate would have been decided soon and for ever we had now
been twenty-four days trying in vain to get westward the men were worn
out with fatigue and they had not had for many nights or days a dry
thing to put on captain fitz roy gave up the attempt to get westward
by the outside coast in the evening we ran in behind false cape horn 
and dropped our anchor in forty-seven fathoms fire flashing from the
windlass as the chain rushed round it how delightful was that still
night after having been so long involved in the din of the warring
elements 

january th the beagle anchored in goeree roads captain fitz
roy having resolved to settle the fuegians according to their wishes 
in ponsonby sound four boats were equipped to carry them there through
the beagle channel this channel which was discovered by captain fitz
roy during the last voyage is a most remarkable feature in the
geography of this or indeed of any other country it may be compared
to the valley of lochness in scotland with its chain of lakes and
friths it is about one hundred and twenty miles long with an average
breadth not subject to any very great variation of about two miles 
and is throughout the greater part so perfectly straight that the
view bounded on each side by a line of mountains gradually becomes
indistinct in the long distance it crosses the southern part of
tierra del fuego in an east and west line and in the middle is joined
at right angles on the south side by an irregular channel which has
been called ponsonby sound this is the residence of jemmy button s
tribe and family 

th three whale-boats and the yawl with a party of twenty-eight 
started under the command of captain fitz roy in the afternoon we
entered the eastern mouth of the channel and shortly afterwards found
a snug little cove concealed by some surrounding islets here we
pitched our tents and lighted our fires nothing could look more
comfortable than this scene the glassy water of the little harbour 
with the branches of the trees hanging over the rocky beach the boats
at anchor the tents supported by the crossed oars and the smoke
curling up the wooded valley formed a picture of quiet retirement the
next day th we smoothly glided onwards in our little fleet and
came to a more inhabited district few if any of these natives could
ever have seen a white man certainly nothing could exceed their
astonishment at the apparition of the four boats fires were lighted
on every point hence the name of tierra del fuego or the land of
fire both to attract our attention and to spread far and wide the
news some of the men ran for miles along the shore i shall never
forget how wild and savage one group appeared suddenly four or five
men came to the edge of an overhanging cliff they were absolutely
naked and their long hair streamed about their faces they held rugged
staffs in their hands and springing from the ground they waved their
arms round their heads and sent forth the most hideous yells 

at dinner-time we landed among a party of fuegians at first they were
not inclined to be friendly for until the captain pulled in ahead of
the other boats they kept their slings in their hands we soon 
however delighted them by trifling presents such as tying red tape
round their heads they liked our biscuit but one of the savages
touched with his finger some of the meat preserved in tin cases which i
was eating and feeling it soft and cold showed as much disgust at it 
as i should have done at putrid blubber jemmy was thoroughly ashamed
of his countrymen and declared his own tribe were quite different in
which he was wofully mistaken it was as easy to please as it was
difficult to satisfy these savages young and old men and children 
never ceased repeating the word yammerschooner which means give
me after pointing to almost every object one after the other even
to the buttons on our coats and saying their favourite word in as many
intonations as possible they would then use it in a neuter sense and
vacantly repeat yammerschooner after yammerschoonering for any
article very eagerly they would by a simple artifice point to their
young women or little children as much as to say if you will not
give it me surely you will to such as these 

at night we endeavoured in vain to find an uninhabited cove and at
last were obliged to bivouac not far from a party of natives they
were very inoffensive as long as they were few in numbers but in the
morning st being joined by others they showed symptoms of
hostility and we thought that we should have come to a skirmish an
european labours under great disadvantages when treating with savages
like these who have not the least idea of the power of fire-arms in
the very act of levelling his musket he appears to the savage far
inferior to a man armed with a bow and arrow a spear or even a sling 
nor is it easy to teach them our superiority except by striking a fatal
blow like wild beasts they do not appear to compare numbers for
each individual if attacked instead of retiring will endeavour to
dash your brains out with a stone as certainly as a tiger under
similar circumstances would tear you captain fitz roy on one occasion
being very anxious from good reasons to frighten away a small party 
first flourished a cutlass near them at which they only laughed he
then twice fired his pistol close to a native the man both times
looked astounded and carefully but quickly rubbed his head he then
stared awhile and gabbled to his companions but he never seemed to
think of running away we can hardly put ourselves in the position of
these savages and understand their actions in the case of this
fuegian the possibility of such a sound as the report of a gun close
to his ear could never have entered his mind he perhaps literally did
not for a second know whether it was a sound or a blow and therefore
very naturally rubbed his head in a similar manner when a savage
sees a mark struck by a bullet it may be some time before he is able
at all to understand how it is effected for the fact of a body being
invisible from its velocity would perhaps be to him an idea totally
inconceivable moreover the extreme force of a bullet that
penetrates a hard substance without tearing it may convince the savage
that it has no force at all certainly i believe that many savages of
the lowest grade such as these of tierra del fuego have seen objects
struck and even small animals killed by the musket without being in
the least aware how deadly an instrument it is 

nd after having passed an unmolested night in what would appear to
be neutral territory between jemmy s tribe and the people whom we saw
yesterday we sailed pleasantly along i do not know anything which
shows more clearly the hostile state of the different tribes than
these wide border or neutral tracts although jemmy button well knew
the force of our party he was at first unwilling to land amidst the
hostile tribe nearest to his own he often told us how the savage oens
men when the leaf red crossed the mountains from the eastern coast
of tierra del fuego and made inroads on the natives of this part of
the country it was most curious to watch him when thus talking and
see his eyes gleaming and his whole face assume a new and wild
expression as we proceeded along the beagle channel the scenery
assumed a peculiar and very magnificent character but the effect was
much lessened from the lowness of the point of view in a boat and from
looking along the valley and thus losing all the beauty of a
succession of ridges the mountains were here about three thousand
feet high and terminated in sharp and jagged points they rose in one
unbroken sweep from the water s edge and were covered to the height of
fourteen or fifteen hundred feet by the dusky-coloured forest it was
most curious to observe as far as the eye could range how level and
truly horizontal the line on the mountain side was at which trees
ceased to grow it precisely resembled the high-water mark of
drift-weed on a sea-beach 

at night we slept close to the junction of ponsonby sound with the
beagle channel a small family of fuegians who were living in the
cove were quiet and inoffensive and soon joined our party round a
blazing fire we were well clothed and though sitting close to the
fire were far from too warm yet these naked savages though further
off were observed to our great surprise to be streaming with
perspiration at undergoing such a roasting they seemed however very
well pleased and all joined in the chorus of the seamen s songs but
the manner in which they were invariably a little behindhand was quite
ludicrous 

during the night the news had spread and early in the morning rd a
fresh party arrived belonging to the tekenika or jemmy s tribe 
several of them had run so fast that their noses were bleeding and
their mouths frothed from the rapidity with which they talked and with
their naked bodies all bedaubed with black white and red they
looked like so many demoniacs who had been fighting we then proceeded
 accompanied by twelve canoes each holding four or five people down
ponsonby sound to the spot where poor jemmy expected to find his mother
and relatives he had already heard that his father was dead but as
he had had a dream in his head to that effect he did not seem to
care much about it and repeatedly comforted himself with the very
natural reflection me no help it he was not able to learn any
particulars regarding his father s death as his relations would not
speak about it 

jemmy was now in a district well known to him and guided the boats to
a quiet pretty cove named woollya surrounded by islets every one of
which and every point had its proper native name we found here a
family of jemmy s tribe but not his relations we made friends with
them and in the evening they sent a canoe to inform jemmy s mother and
brothers the cove was bordered by some acres of good sloping land 
not covered as elsewhere either by peat or by forest-trees captain
fitz roy originally intended as before stated to have taken york
minster and fuegia to their own tribe on the west coast but as they
expressed a wish to remain here and as the spot was singularly
favourable captain fitz roy determined to settle here the whole party 
including matthews the missionary five days were spent in building
for them three large wigwams in landing their goods in digging two
gardens and sowing seeds 

the next morning after our arrival the th the fuegians began to
pour in and jemmy s mother and brothers arrived jemmy recognised the
stentorian voice of one of his brothers at a prodigious distance the
meeting was less interesting than that between a horse turned out into
a field when he joins an old companion there was no demonstration of
affection they simply stared for a short time at each other and the
mother immediately went to look after her canoe we heard however 
through york that the mother has been inconsolable for the loss of
jemmy and had searched everywhere for him thinking that he might have
been left after having been taken in the boat the women took much
notice of and were very kind to fuegia we had already perceived that
jemmy had almost forgotten his own language i should think there was
scarcely another human being with so small a stock of language for his
english was very imperfect it was laughable but almost pitiable to
hear him speak to his wild brother in english and then ask him in
spanish no sabe whether he did not understand him 

everything went on peaceably during the three next days whilst the
gardens were digging and wigwams building we estimated the number of
natives at about one hundred and twenty the women worked hard whilst
the men lounged about all day long watching us they asked for
everything they saw and stole what they could they were delighted at
our dancing and singing and were particularly interested at seeing us
wash in a neighbouring brook they did not pay much attention to
anything else not even to our boats of all the things which york
saw during his absence from his country nothing seems more to have
astonished him than an ostrich near maldonado breathless with
astonishment he came running to mr bynoe with whom he was out
walking oh mr bynoe oh bird all same horse much as our white
skins surprised the natives by mr low s account a negro-cook to a
sealing vessel did so more effectually and the poor fellow was so
mobbed and shouted at that he would never go on shore again 
everything went on so quietly that some of the officers and myself took
long walks in the surrounding hills and woods suddenly however on
the th every woman and child disappeared we were all uneasy at
this as neither york nor jemmy could make out the cause it was
thought by some that they had been frightened by our cleaning and
firing off our muskets on the previous evening by others that it was
owing to offence taken by an old savage who when told to keep further
off had coolly spit in the sentry s face and had then by gestures
acted over a sleeping fuegian plainly showed as it was said that he
should like to cut up and eat our man captain fitz roy to avoid the
chance of an encounter which would have been fatal to so many of the
fuegians thought it advisable for us to sleep at a cove a few miles
distant matthews with his usual quiet fortitude remarkable in a man
apparently possessing little energy of character determined to stay
with the fuegians who evinced no alarm for themselves and so we left
them to pass their first awful night 

on our return in the morning th we were delighted to find all
quiet and the men employed in their canoes spearing fish captain
fitz roy determined to send the yawl and one whale-boat back to the
ship and to proceed with the two other boats one under his own
command in which he most kindly allowed me to accompany him and one
under mr hammond to survey the western parts of the beagle channel 
and afterwards to return and visit the settlement the day to our
astonishment was overpoweringly hot so that our skins were scorched 
with this beautiful weather the view in the middle of the beagle
channel was very remarkable looking towards either hand no object
intercepted the vanishing points of this long canal between the
mountains the circumstance of its being an arm of the sea was
rendered very evident by several huge whales spouting in different
directions on one occasion i saw two of these monsters probably male
and female slowly swimming one after the other within less than a
stone s throw of the shore over which the beech-tree extended its
branches we sailed on till it was dark and then pitched our tents in
a quiet creek the greatest luxury was to find for our beds a beach of
pebbles for they were dry and yielded to the body peaty soil is
damp rock is uneven and hard sand gets into one s meat when cooked
and eaten boat-fashion but when lying in our blanket-bags on a good
bed of smooth pebbles we passed most comfortable nights 

it was my watch till one o clock there is something very solemn in
these scenes at no time does the consciousness in what a remote
corner of the world you are then standing come so strongly before the
mind everything tends to this effect the stillness of the night is
interrupted only by the heavy breathing of the seamen beneath the
tents and sometimes by the cry of a night-bird the occasional
barking of a dog heard in the distance reminds one that it is the
land of the savage 

january th early in the morning we arrived at the point where the
beagle channel divides into two arms and we entered the northern one 
the scenery here becomes even grander than before the lofty mountains
on the north side compose the granitic axis or backbone of the country
and boldly rise to a height of between three and four thousand feet 
with one peak above six thousand feet they are covered by a wide
mantle of perpetual snow and numerous cascades pour their waters 
through the woods into the narrow channel below in many parts 
magnificent glaciers extend from the mountain side to the water s edge 
it is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the
beryl-like blue of these glaciers and especially as contrasted with
the dead white of the upper expanse of snow the fragments which had
fallen from the glacier into the water were floating away and the
channel with its icebergs presented for the space of a mile a
miniature likeness of the polar sea the boats being hauled on shore
at our dinner-hour we were admiring from the distance of half a mile a
perpendicular cliff of ice and were wishing that some more fragments
would fall at last down came a mass with a roaring noise and
immediately we saw the smooth outline of a wave travelling towards us 
the men ran down as quickly as they could to the boats for the chance
of their being dashed to pieces was evident one of the seamen just
caught hold of the bows as the curling breaker reached it he was
knocked over and over but not hurt and the boats though thrice lifted
on high and let fall again received no damage this was most
fortunate for us for we were a hundred miles distant from the ship 
and we should have been left without provisions or fire-arms i had
previously observed that some large fragments of rock on the beach had
been lately displaced but until seeing this wave i did not understand
the cause one side of the creek was formed by a spur of mica-slate 
the head by a cliff of ice about forty feet high and the other side by
a promontory fifty feet high built up of huge rounded fragments of
granite and mica-slate out of which old trees were growing this
promontory was evidently a moraine heaped up at a period when the
glacier had greater dimensions 

when we reached the western mouth of this northern branch of the beagle
channel we sailed amongst many unknown desolate islands and the
weather was wretchedly bad we met with no natives the coast was
almost everywhere so steep that we had several times to pull many
miles before we could find space enough to pitch our two tents one
night we slept on large round boulders with putrefying sea-weed
between them and when the tide rose we had to get up and move our
blanket-bags the farthest point westward which we reached was stewart
island a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles from our ship 
we returned into the beagle channel by the southern arm and thence
proceeded with no adventure back to ponsonby sound 

february th we arrived at woollya matthews gave so bad an account
of the conduct of the fuegians that captain fitz roy determined to
take him back to the beagle and ultimately he was left at new zealand 
where his brother was a missionary from the time of our leaving a
regular system of plunder commenced fresh parties of the natives kept
arriving york and jemmy lost many things and matthews almost
everything which had not been concealed underground every article
seemed to have been torn up and divided by the natives matthews
described the watch he was obliged always to keep as most harassing 
night and day he was surrounded by the natives who tried to tire him
out by making an incessant noise close to his head one day an old
man whom matthews asked to leave his wigwam immediately returned with
a large stone in his hand another day a whole party came armed with
stones and stakes and some of the younger men and jemmy s brother were
crying matthews met them with presents another party showed by signs
that they wished to strip him naked and pluck all the hairs out of his
face and body i think we arrived just in time to save his life 
jemmy s relatives had been so vain and foolish that they had showed to
strangers their plunder and their manner of obtaining it it was
quite melancholy leaving the three fuegians with their savage
countrymen but it was a great comfort that they had no personal fears 
york being a powerful resolute man was pretty sure to get on well 
together with his wife fuegia poor jemmy looked rather disconsolate 
and would then i have little doubt have been glad to have returned
with us his own brother had stolen many things from him and as he
remarked what fashion call that he abused his countrymen all bad
men no sabe know nothing and though i never heard him swear
before damned fools our three fuegians though they had been only
three years with civilized men would i am sure have been glad to
have retained their new habits but this was obviously impossible i
fear it is more than doubtful whether their visit will have been of
any use to them 

in the evening with matthews on board we made sail back to the ship 
not by the beagle channel but by the southern coast the boats were
heavily laden and the sea rough and we had a dangerous passage by
the evening of the th we were on board the beagle after an absence of
twenty days during which time we had gone three hundred miles in the
open boats on the th captain fitz roy paid a visit by himself to
the fuegians and found them going on well and that they had lost very
few more things 


on the last day of february in the succeeding year the beagle
anchored in a beautiful little cove at the eastern entrance of the
beagle channel captain fitz roy determined on the bold and as it
proved successful attempt to beat against the westerly winds by the
same route which we had followed in the boats to the settlement at
woollya we did not see many natives until we were near ponsonby sound 
where we were followed by ten or twelve canoes the natives did not at
all understand the reason of our tacking and instead of meeting us at
each tack vainly strove to follow us in our zigzag course i was
amused at finding what a difference the circumstance of being quite
superior in force made in the interest of beholding these savages 
while in the boats i got to hate the very sound of their voices so
much trouble did they give us the first and last word was
 yammerschooner when entering some quiet little cove we have looked
round and thought to pass a quiet night the odious word
 yammerschooner has shrilly sounded from some gloomy nook and then
the little signal-smoke has curled up to spread the news far and wide 
on leaving some place we have said to each other thank heaven we
have at last fairly left these wretches when one more faint hallo
from an all-powerful voice heard at a prodigious distance would reach
our ears and clearly could we distinguish yammerschooner but now 
the more fuegians the merrier and very merry work it was both
parties laughing wondering gaping at each other we pitying them for
giving us good fish and crabs for rags etc they grasping at the
chance of finding people so foolish as to exchange such splendid
ornaments for a good supper it was most amusing to see the
undisguised smile of satisfaction with which one young woman with her
face painted black tied several bits of scarlet cloth round her head
with rushes her husband who enjoyed the very universal privilege in
this country of possessing two wives evidently became jealous of all
the attention paid to his young wife and after a consultation with
his naked beauties was paddled away by them 

some of the fuegians plainly showed that they had a fair notion of
barter i gave one man a large nail a most valuable present without
making any signs for a return but he immediately picked out two fish 
and handed them up on the point of his spear if any present was
designed for one canoe and it fell near another it was invariably
given to the right owner the fuegian boy whom mr low had on board
showed by going into the most violent passion that he quite
understood the reproach of being called a liar which in truth he was 
we were this time as on all former occasions much surprised at the
little notice or rather none whatever which was taken of many things 
the use of which must have been evident to the natives simple
circumstances such as the beauty of scarlet cloth or blue beads the
absence of women our care in washing ourselves excited their
admiration far more than any grand or complicated object such as our
ship bougainville has well remarked concerning these people that
they treat the chefs d oeuvre de l industrie humaine comme ils
traitent les loix de la nature et ses phenomenes 

on the th of march we anchored in a cove at woollya but we saw not a
soul there we were alarmed at this for the natives in ponsonby sound
showed by gestures that there had been fighting and we afterwards
heard that the dreaded oens men had made a descent soon a canoe with
a little flag flying was seen approaching with one of the men in it
washing the paint off his face this man was poor jemmy now a thin 
haggard savage with long disordered hair and naked except a bit of
blanket round his waist we did not recognize him till he was close to
us for he was ashamed of himself and turned his back to the ship we
had left him plump fat clean and well-dressed i never saw so
complete and grievous a change as soon however as he was clothed 
and the first flurry was over things wore a good appearance he dined
with captain fitz roy and ate his dinner as tidily as formerly he
told us that he had too much meaning enough to eat that he was not
cold that his relations were very good people and that he did not
wish to go back to england in the evening we found out the cause of
this great change in jemmy s feelings in the arrival of his young and
nice-looking wife with his usual good feeling he brought two
beautiful otter-skins for two of his best friends and some spear-heads
and arrows made with his own hands for the captain he said he had
built a canoe for himself and he boasted that he could talk a little
of his own language but it is a most singular fact that he appears
to have taught all his tribe some english an old man spontaneously
announced jemmy button s wife jemmy had lost all his property he
told us that york minster had built a large canoe and with his wife
fuegia had several months since gone to his own country and had
taken farewell by an act of consummate villainy he persuaded jemmy and
his mother to come with him and then on the way deserted them by
night stealing every article of their property 

jemmy went to sleep on shore and in the morning returned and remained
on board till the ship got under way which frightened his wife who
continued crying violently till he got into his canoe he returned
loaded with valuable property every soul on board was heartily sorry
to shake hands with him for the last time i do not now doubt that he
will be as happy as perhaps happier than if he had never left his own
country every one must sincerely hope that captain fitz roy s noble
hope may be fulfilled of being rewarded for the many generous
sacrifices which he made for these fuegians by some shipwrecked sailor
being protected by the descendants of jemmy button and his tribe when
jemmy reached the shore he lighted a signal fire and the smoke curled
up bidding us a last and long farewell as the ship stood on her
course into the open sea 

the perfect equality among the individuals composing the fuegian tribes
must for a long time retard their civilization as we see those
animals whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a
chief are most capable of improvement so is it with the races of
mankind whether we look at it as a cause or a consequence the more
civilized always have the most artificial governments for instance 
the inhabitants of otaheite who when first discovered were governed
by hereditary kings had arrived at a far higher grade than another
branch of the same people the new zealanders who although benefited
by being compelled to turn their attention to agriculture were
republicans in the most absolute sense in tierra del fuego until
some chief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired
advantage such as the domesticated animals it seems scarcely possible
that the political state of the country can be improved at present 
even a piece of cloth given to one is torn into shreds and distributed 
and no one individual becomes richer than another on the other hand 
it is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is
property of some sort by which he might manifest his superiority and
increase his power 

i believe in this extreme part of south america man exists in a lower
state of improvement than in any other part of the world the south
sea islanders of the two races inhabiting the pacific are
comparatively civilized the esquimau in his subterranean hut enjoys
some of the comforts of life and in his canoe when fully equipped 
manifests much skill some of the tribes of southern africa prowling
about in search of roots and living concealed on the wild and arid
plains are sufficiently wretched the australian in the simplicity
of the arts of life comes nearest the fuegian he can however boast
of his boomerang his spear and throwing-stick his method of climbing
trees of tracking animals and of hunting although the australian
may be superior in acquirements it by no means follows that he is
likewise superior in mental capacity indeed from what i saw of the
fuegians when on board and from what i have read of the australians i
should think the case was exactly the reverse 

 this substance when dry is tolerably compact and of little
specific gravity professor ehrenberg has examined it he states konig
akad der wissen berlin feb that it is composed of infusoria 
including fourteen polygastrica and four phytolitharia he says that
they are all inhabitants of fresh-water this is a beautiful example of
the results obtainable through professor ehrenberg s microscopic
researches for jemmy button told me that it is always collected at the
bottoms of mountain-brooks it is moreover a striking fact that in
the geographical distribution of the infusoria which are well known to
have very wide ranges that all the species in this substance although
brought from the extreme southern point of tierra del fuego are old 
known forms 

 one day off the east coast of tierra del fuego we saw a grand
sight in several spermaceti whales jumping upright quite out of the
water with the exception of their tail-fins as they fell down
sideways they splashed the water high up and the sound reverberated
like a distant broadside 

 captain sulivan who since his voyage in the beagle has been
employed on the survey of the falkland islands heard from a sealer in
 that when in the western part of the strait of magellan he
was astonished by a native woman coming on board who could talk some
english without doubt this was fuega basket she lived i fear the
term probably bears a double interpretation some days on board

strait of magellan climate of the southern coasts

strait of magellan port famine ascent of mount tarn forests edible

fuego climate fruit-trees and productions of the southern
coasts height of snow-line on the cordillera descent of glaciers to
the sea icebergs formed transportal of boulders climate and
productions of the antarctic islands preservation of frozen
carcasses recapitulation 


in the end of may we entered for a second time the eastern mouth
of the strait of magellan the country on both sides of this part of
the strait consists of nearly level plains like those of patagonia 
cape negro a little within the second narrows may be considered as
the point where the land begins to assume the marked features of tierra
del fuego on the east coast south of the strait broken park-like
scenery in a like manner connects these two countries which are
opposed to each other in almost every feature it is truly surprising
to find in a space of twenty miles such a change in the landscape if
we take a rather greater distance as between port famine and gregory
bay that is about sixty miles the difference is still more wonderful 
at the former place we have rounded mountains concealed by impervious
forests which are drenched with the rain brought by an endless
succession of gales while at cape gregory there is a clear and bright
blue sky over the dry and sterile plains the atmospheric currents 
 although rapid turbulent and unconfined by any apparent limits 
yet seem to follow like a river in its bed a regularly determined
course 

during our previous visit in january we had an interview at cape
gregory with the famous so-called gigantic patagonians who gave us a
cordial reception their height appears greater than it really is 
from their large guanaco mantles their long flowing hair and general
figure on an average their height is about six feet with some men
taller and only a few shorter and the women are also tall altogether
they are certainly the tallest race which we anywhere saw in features
they strikingly resemble the more northern indians whom i saw with
rosas but they have a wilder and more formidable appearance their
faces were much painted with red and black and one man was ringed and
dotted with white like a fuegian captain fitz roy offered to take any
three of them on board and all seemed determined to be of the three 
it was long before we could clear the boat at last we got on board
with our three giants who dined with the captain and behaved quite
like gentlemen helping themselves with knives forks and spoons 
nothing was so much relished as sugar this tribe has had so much
communication with sealers and whalers that most of the men can speak a
little english and spanish and they are half civilized and
proportionally demoralized 

the next morning a large party went on shore to barter for skins and
ostrich-feathers fire-arms being refused tobacco was in greatest
request far more so than axes or tools the whole population of the
toldos men women and children were arranged on a bank it was an
amusing scene and it was impossible not to like the so-called giants 
they were so thoroughly good-humoured and unsuspecting they asked us
to come again they seem to like to have europeans to live with them 
and old maria an important woman in the tribe once begged mr low to
leave any one of his sailors with them they spend the greater part of
the year here but in summer they hunt along the foot of the
cordillera sometimes they travel as far as the rio negro miles to
the north they are well stocked with horses each man having 
according to mr low six or seven and all the women and even
children their one own horse in the time of sarmiento these
indians had bows and arrows now long since disused they then also
possessed some horses this is a very curious fact showing the
extraordinarily rapid multiplication of horses in south america the
horse was first landed at buenos ayres in and the colony being
then for a time deserted the horse ran wild in only
forty-three years afterwards we hear of them at the strait of
magellan mr low informs me that a neighbouring tribe of
foot-indians is now changing into horse-indians the tribe at gregory
bay giving them their worn-out horses and sending in winter a few of
their best skilled men to hunt for them 

june st we anchored in the fine bay of port famine it was now the
beginning of winter and i never saw a more cheerless prospect the
dusky woods piebald with snow could be only seen indistinctly 
through a drizzling hazy atmosphere we were however lucky in
getting two fine days on one of these mount sarmiento a distant
mountain feet high presented a very noble spectacle i was
frequently surprised in the scenery of tierra del fuego at the little
apparent elevation of mountains really lofty i suspect it is owing to
a cause which would not at first be imagined namely that the whole
mass from the summit to the water s edge is generally in full view i
remember having seen a mountain first from the beagle channel where
the whole sweep from the summit to the base was full in view and then
from ponsonby sound across several successive ridges and it was
curious to observe in the latter case as each fresh ridge afforded
fresh means of judging of the distance how the mountain rose in height 

before reaching port famine two men were seen running along the shore
and hailing the ship a boat was sent for them they turned out to be
two sailors who had run away from a sealing-vessel and had joined the
patagonians these indians had treated them with their usual
disinterested hospitality they had parted company through accident 
and were then proceeding to port famine in hopes of finding some ship 
i dare say they were worthless vagabonds but i never saw more
miserable-looking ones they had been living for some days on
mussel-shells and berries and their tattered clothes had been burnt by
sleeping so near their fires they had been exposed night and day 
without any shelter to the late incessant gales with rain sleet and
snow and yet they were in good health 

during our stay at port famine the fuegians twice came and plagued us 
as there were many instruments clothes and men on shore it was
thought necessary to frighten them away the first time a few great
guns were fired when they were far distant it was most ludicrous to
watch through a glass the indians as often as the shot struck the
water take up stones and as a bold defiance throw them towards the
ship though about a mile and a half distant a boat was sent with
orders to fire a few musket-shots wide of them the fuegians hid
themselves behind the trees and for every discharge of the muskets
they fired their arrows all however fell short of the boat and the
officer as he pointed at them laughed this made the fuegians frantic
with passion and they shook their mantles in vain rage at last 
seeing the balls cut and strike the trees they ran away and we were
left in peace and quietness during the former voyage the fuegians
were here very troublesome and to frighten them a rocket was fired at
night over their wigwams it answered effectually and one of the
officers told me that the clamour first raised and the barking of the
dogs was quite ludicrous in contrast with the profound silence which
in a minute or two afterwards prevailed the next morning not a single
fuegian was in the neighbourhood 

when the beagle was here in the month of february i started one
morning at four o clock to ascend mount tarn which is feet high 
and is the most elevated point in this immediate district we went in
a boat to the foot of the mountain but unluckily not to the best
part and then began our ascent the forest commences at the line of
high-water mark and during the first two hours i gave over all hopes
of reaching the summit so thick was the wood that it was necessary
to have constant recourse to the compass for every landmark though in
a mountainous country was completely shut out in the deep ravines 
the death-like scene of desolation exceeded all description outside it
was blowing a gale but in these hollows not even a breath of wind
stirred the leaves of the tallest trees so gloomy cold and wet was
every part that not even the fungi mosses or ferns could flourish 
in the valleys it was scarcely possible to crawl along they were so
completely barricaded by great mouldering trunks which had fallen down
in every direction when passing over these natural bridges one s
course was often arrested by sinking knee deep into the rotten wood at
other times when attempting to lean against a firm tree one was
startled by finding a mass of decayed matter ready to fall at the
slightest touch we at last found ourselves among the stunted trees 
and then soon reached the bare ridge which conducted us to the summit 
here was a view characteristic of tierra del fuego irregular chains of
hills mottled with patches of snow deep yellowish-green valleys and
arms of the sea intersecting the land in many directions the strong
wind was piercingly cold and the atmosphere rather hazy so that we
did not stay long on the top of the mountain our descent was not
quite so laborious as our ascent for the weight of the body forced a
passage and all the slips and falls were in the right direction 

i have already mentioned the sombre and dull character of the evergreen
forests in which two or three species of trees grow to the
exclusion of all others above the forest land there are many dwarf
alpine plants which all spring from the mass of peat and help to
compose it these plants are very remarkable from their close alliance
with the species growing on the mountains of europe though so many
thousand miles distant the central part of tierra del fuego where
the clay-slate formation occurs is most favourable to the growth of
trees on the outer coast the poorer granitic soil and a situation
more exposed to the violent winds do not allow of their attaining any
great size near port famine i have seen more large trees than
anywhere else i measured a winter s bark which was four feet six
inches in girth and several of the beech were as much as thirteen
feet captain king also mentions a beech which was seven feet in
diameter seventeen feet above the roots 

there is one vegetable production deserving notice from its importance
as an article of food to the fuegians it is a globular bright-yellow
fungus which grows in vast numbers on the beech-trees when young it
is elastic and turgid with

 picture 

a smooth surface but when mature it shrinks becomes tougher and has
its entire surface deeply pitted or honey-combed as represented in the
accompanying woodcut this fungus belongs to a new and curious genus 
 i found a second species on another species of beech in chile and
dr hooker informs me that just lately a third species has been
discovered on a third species of beech in van diernan s land how
singular is this relationship between parasitical fungi and the trees
on which they grow in distant parts of the world in tierra del fuego
the fungus in its tough and mature state is collected in large
quantities by the women and children and is eaten un-cooked it has a
mucilaginous slightly sweet taste with a faint smell like that of a
mushroom with the exception of a few berries chiefly of a dwarf
arbutus the natives eat no vegetable food besides this fungus in new
zealand before the introduction of the potato the roots of the fern
were largely consumed at the present time i believe tierra del fuego
is the only country in the world where a cryptogamic plant affords a
staple article of food 

the zoology of tierra del fuego as might have been expected from the
nature of its climate and vegetation is very poor of mammalia 
besides whales and seals there is one bat a kind of mouse reithrodon
chinchilloides two true mice a ctenomys allied to or identical with
the tucutuco two foxes canis magellanicus and c azarae a
sea-otter the guanaco and a deer most of these animals inhabit only
the drier eastern parts of the country and the deer has never been
seen south of the strait of magellan observing the general
correspondence of the cliffs of soft sandstone mud and shingle on
the opposite sides of the strait and on some intervening islands one
is strongly tempted to believe that the land was once joined and thus
allowed animals so delicate and helpless as the tucutuco and reithrodon
to pass over the correspondence of the cliffs is far from proving any
junction because such cliffs generally are formed by the intersection
of sloping deposits which before the elevation of the land had been
accumulated near the then existing shores it is however a
remarkable coincidence that in the two large islands cut off by the
beagle channel from the rest of tierra del fuego one has cliffs
composed of matter that may be called stratified alluvium which front
similar ones on the opposite side of the channel while the other is
exclusively bordered by old crystalline rocks in the former called
navarin island both foxes and guanacos occur but in the latter hoste
island although similar in every respect and only separated by a
channel a little more than half a mile wide i have the word of jemmy
button for saying that neither of these animals are found 

the gloomy woods are inhabited by few birds occasionally the plaintive
note of a white-tufted tyrant-flycatcher myiobius albiceps may be
heard concealed near the summit of the most lofty trees and more
rarely the loud strange cry of a black wood-pecker with a fine scarlet
crest on its head a little dusky-coloured wren scytalopus
magellanicus hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the
fallen and decaying trunks but the creeper oxyurus tupinieri is the
commonest bird in the country throughout the beech forests high up
and low down in the most gloomy wet and impenetrable ravines it may
be met with this little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it
really is from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any
person who enters these silent woods continually uttering a harsh
twitter it flutters from tree to tree within a few feet of the
intruder s face it is far from wishing for the modest concealment of
the true creeper certhia familiaris nor does it like that bird run
up the trunks of trees but industriously after the manner of a
willow-wren hops about and searches for insects on every twig and
branch in the more open parts three or four species of finches a
thrush a starling or icterus two opetiorhynchi and several hawks
and owls occur 

the absence of any species whatever in the whole class of reptiles is
a marked feature in the zoology of this country as well as in that of
the falkland islands i do not ground this statement merely on my own
observation but i heard it from the spanish inhabitants of the latter
place and from jemmy button with regard to tierra del fuego on the
banks of the santa cruz in degs south i saw a frog and it is
not improbable that these animals as well as lizards may be found as
far south as the strait of magellan where the country retains the
character of patagonia but within the damp and cold limit of tierra
del fuego not one occurs that the climate would not have suited some
of the orders such as lizards might have been foreseen but with
respect to frogs this was not so obvious 

beetles occur in very small numbers it was long before i could believe
that a country as large as scotland covered with vegetable productions
and with a variety of stations could be so unproductive the few
which i found were alpine species harpalidae and heteromidae living
under stones the vegetable-feeding chrysomelidae so eminently
characteristic of the tropics are here almost entirely absent i
saw very few flies butterflies or bees and no crickets or
orthoptera in the pools of water i found but a few aquatic beetles 
and not any fresh-water shells succinea at first appears an exception 
but here it must be called a terrestrial shell for it lives on the
damp herbage far from the water land-shells could be procured only in
the same alpine situations with the beetles i have already contrasted
the climate as well as the general appearance of tierra del fuego with
that of patagonia and the difference is strongly exemplified in the
entomology i do not believe they have one species in common 
certainly the general character of the insects is widely different 

if we turn from the land to the sea we shall find the latter as
abundantly stocked with living creatures as the former is poorly so in
all parts of the world a rocky and partially protected shore perhaps
supports in a given space a greater number of individual animals than
any other station there is one marine production which from its
importance is worthy of a particular history it is the kelp or
macrocystis pyrifera this plant grows on every rock from low-water
mark to a great depth both on the outer coast and within the channels 
 i believe during the voyages of the adventure and beagle not one
rock near the surface was discovered which was not buoyed by this
floating weed the good service it thus affords to vessels navigating
near this stormy land is evident and it certainly has saved many a one
from being wrecked i know few things more surprising than to see this
plant growing and flourishing amidst those great breakers of the
western ocean which no mass of rock let it be ever so hard can long
resist the stem is round slimy and smooth and seldom has a
diameter of so much as an inch a few taken together are sufficiently
strong to support the weight of the large loose stones to which in the
inland channels they grow attached and yet some of these stones were
so heavy that when drawn to the surface they could scarcely be lifted
into a boat by one person captain cook in his second voyage says 
that this plant at kerguelen land rises from a greater depth than
twenty-four fathoms and as it does not grow in a perpendicular
direction but makes a very acute angle with the bottom and much of it
afterwards spreads many fathoms on the surface of the sea i am well
warranted to say that some of it grows to the length of sixty fathoms
and upwards i do not suppose the stem of any other plant attains so
great a length as three hundred and sixty feet as stated by captain
cook captain fitz roy moreover found it growing up from the
greater depth of forty-five fathoms the beds of this sea-weed even
when of not great breadth make excellent natural floating breakwaters 
it is quite curious to see in an exposed harbour how soon the waves
from the open sea as they travel through the straggling stems sink in
height and pass into smooth water 

the number of living creatures of all orders whose existence
intimately depends on the kelp is wonderful a great volume might be
written describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of sea-weed 
almost all the leaves excepting those that float on the surface are
so thickly incrusted with corallines as to be of a white colour we
find exquisitely delicate structures some inhabited by simple
hydra-like polypi others by more organized kinds and beautiful
compound ascidiae on the leaves also various patelliform shells 
trochi uncovered molluscs and some bivalves are attached innumerable
crustacea frequent every part of the plant on shaking the great
entangled roots a pile of small fish shells cuttle-fish crabs of
all orders sea-eggs star-fish beautiful holuthuriae planariae and
crawling nereidous animals of a multitude of forms all fall out
together often as i recurred to a branch of the kelp i never failed
to discover animals of new and curious structures in chiloe where
the kelp does not thrive very well the numerous shells corallines 
and crustacea are absent but there yet remain a few of the
flustraceae and some compound ascidiae the latter however are of
different species from those in tierra del fuego we see here the fucus
possessing a wider range than the animals which use it as an abode i
can only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere
with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions yet if in any
country a forest was destroyed i do not believe nearly so many species
of animals would perish as would here from the destruction of the
kelp amidst the leaves of this plant numerous species of fish live 
which nowhere else could find food or shelter with their destruction
the many cormorants and other fishing birds the otters seals and
porpoises would soon perish also and lastly the fuegian savage the
miserable lord of this miserable land would redouble his cannibal
feast decrease in numbers and perhaps cease to exist 

june th we weighed anchor early in the morning and left port famine 
captain fitz roy determined to leave the strait of magellan by the
magdalen channel which had not long been discovered our course lay
due south down that gloomy passage which i have before alluded to as
appearing to lead to another and worse world the wind was fair but
the atmosphere was very thick so that we missed much curious scenery 
the dark ragged clouds were rapidly driven over the mountains from
their summits nearly down to their bases the glimpses which we caught
through the dusky mass were highly interesting jagged points cones of
snow blue glaciers strong outlines marked on a lurid sky were seen
at different distances and heights in the midst of such scenery we
anchored at cape turn close to mount sarmiento which was then hidden
in the clouds at the base of the lofty and almost perpendicular sides
of our little cove there was one deserted wigwam and it alone reminded
us that man sometimes wandered into these desolate regions but it
would be difficult to imagine a scene where he seemed to have fewer
claims or less authority the inanimate works of nature rock ice 
snow wind and water all warring with each other yet combined
against man here reigned in absolute sovereignty 

june th in the morning we were delighted by seeing the veil of mist
gradually rise from sarmiento and display it to our view this
mountain which is one of the highest in tierra del fuego has an
altitude of feet its base for about an eighth of its total
height is clothed by dusky woods and above this a field of snow
extends to the summit these vast piles of snow which never melt and
seem destined to last as long as the world holds together present a
noble and even sublime spectacle the outline of the mountain was
admirably clear and defined owing to the abundance of light reflected
from the white and glittering surface no shadows were cast on any
part and those lines which intersected the sky could alone be
distinguished hence the mass stood out in the boldest relief several
glaciers descended in a winding course from the upper great expanse of
snow to the sea-coast they may be likened to great frozen niagaras 
and perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are full as beautiful as the
moving ones of water by night we reached the western part of the
channel but the water was so deep that no anchorage could be found we
were in consequence obliged to stand off and on in this narrow arm of
the sea during a pitch-dark night of fourteen hours long 

june th in the morning we made the best of our way into the open
pacific the western coast generally consists of low rounded quite
barren hills of granite and greenstone sir j narborough called one
part south desolation because it is so desolate a land to behold 
and well indeed might he say so outside the main islands there are
numberless scattered rocks on which the long swell of the open ocean
incessantly rages we passed out between the east and west furies and
a little farther northward there are so many breakers that the sea is
called the milky way one sight of such a coast is enough to make a
landsman dream for a week about shipwrecks peril and death and with
this sight we bade farewell for ever to tierra del fuego 

the following discussion on the climate of the southern parts of the
continent with relation to its productions on the snow-line on the
extraordinarily low descent of the glaciers and on the zone of
perpetual congelation in the antarctic islands may be passed over by
any one not interested in these curious subjects or the final
recapitulation alone may be read i shall however here give only an
abstract and must refer for details to the thirteenth chapter and the
appendix of the former edition of this work 

on the climate and productions of tierra del fuego and of the
south-west coast the following table gives the mean temperature of
tierra del fuego the falkland islands and for comparison that of
dublin 

 summer winter mean of summer
 latitude temp temp and winter
 tierra del fuego s 
 falkland islands s 
 dublin n 


hence we see that the central part of tierra del fuego is colder in
winter and no less than degs less hot in summer than dublin 
according to von buch the mean temperature of july not the hottest
month in the year at saltenfiord in norway is as high as degs 
and this place is actually degs nearer the pole than port famine 
 inhospitable as this climate appears to our feelings evergreen
trees flourish luxuriantly under it humming-birds may be seen sucking
the flowers and parrots feeding on the seeds of the winter s bark in
lat degs s i have already remarked to what a degree the sea
swarms with living creatures and the shells such as the patellae 
fissurellae chitons and barnacles according to mr g b sowerby 
are of a much larger size and of a more vigorous growth than the
analogous species in the northern hemisphere a large voluta is
abundant in southern tierra del fuego and the falkland islands at
bahia blanca in lat degs s the most abundant shells were three
species of oliva one of large size one or two volutas and a
terebra now these are amongst the best characterized tropical forms 
it is doubtful whether even one small species of oliva exists on the
southern shores of europe and there are no species of the two other
genera if a geologist were to find in lat degs on the coast of
portugal a bed containing numerous shells belonging to three species of
oliva to a voluta and terebra he would probably assert that the
climate at the period of their existence must have been tropical but
judging from south america such an inference might be erroneous 

the equable humid and windy climate of tierra del fuego extends with
only a small increase of heat for many degrees along the west coast of
the continent the forests for miles northward of cape horn have
a very similar aspect as a proof of the equable climate even for 
or miles still further northward i may mention that in chiloe
 corresponding in latitude with the northern parts of spain the peach
seldom produces fruit whilst strawberries and apples thrive to
perfection even the crops of barley and wheat are often brought
into the houses to be dried and ripened at valdivia in the same
latitude of degs with madrid grapes and figs ripen but are not
common olives seldom ripen even partially and oranges not at all 
these fruits in corresponding latitudes in europe are well known to
succeed to perfection and even in this continent at the rio negro 
under nearly the same parallel with valdivia sweet potatoes
 convolvulus are cultivated and grapes figs olives oranges water
and musk melons produce abundant fruit although the humid and
equable climate of chiloe and of the coast northward and southward of
it is so unfavourable to our fruits yet the native forests from lat 
 to degs almost rival in luxuriance those of the glowing
intertropical regions stately trees of many kinds with smooth and
highly coloured barks are loaded by parasitical monocotyledonous
plants large and elegant ferns are numerous and arborescent grasses
entwine the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty or
forty feet above the ground palm-trees grow in lat degs an
arborescent grass very like a bamboo in degs and another closely
allied kind of great length but not erect flourishes even as far
south as degs s 

an equable climate evidently due to the large area of sea compared
with the land seems to extend over the greater part of the southern
hemisphere and as a consequence the vegetation partakes of a
semi-tropical character tree-ferns thrive luxuriantly in van diemen s
land lat degs and i measured one trunk no less than six feet in
circumference an arborescent fern was found by forster in new zealand
in degs where orchideous plants are parasitical on the trees in
the auckland islands ferns according to dr dieffenbach have
trunks so thick and high that they may be almost called tree-ferns and
in these islands and even as far south as lat degs in the
macquarrie islands parrots abound 

on the height of the snow-line and on the descent of the glaciers in
south america for the detailed authorities for the following table i

as the height of the plane of perpetual snow seems chiefly to be
determined by the extreme heat of the summer rather than by the mean
temperature of the year we ought not to be surprised at its descent in
the strait of magellan where the summer is so cool to only or
 feet above the level of the sea although in norway we must
travel to between lat and degs n that is about degs 
nearer the pole to meet with perpetual snow at this low level the
difference in height namely about feet between the snow-line on
the cordillera behind chiloe with its highest points ranging from only
 to feet and in central chile a distance of only 
degs of latitude is truly wonderful the land from the southward of
chiloe to near concepcion lat degs is hidden by one dense forest
dripping with moisture the sky is cloudy and we have seen how badly
the fruits of southern europe succeed in central chile on the other
hand a little northward of concepcion the sky is generally clear 
rain does not fall for the seven summer months and southern european
fruits succeed admirably and even the sugar-cane has been cultivated 
 no doubt the plane of perpetual snow undergoes the above
remarkable flexure of feet unparalleled in other parts of the
world not far from the latitude of concepcion where the land ceases
to be covered with forest-trees for trees in south america indicate a
rainy climate and rain a clouded sky and little heat in summer 

the descent of glaciers to the sea must i conceive mainly depend
 subject of course to a proper supply of snow in the upper region on
the lowness of the line of perpetual snow on steep mountains near the
coast as the snow-line is so low in tierra del fuego we might have
expected that many of the glaciers would have reached the sea 
nevertheless i was astonished when i first saw a range only from 
to feet in height in the latitude of cumberland with every
valley filled with streams of ice descending to the sea-coast almost
every arm of the sea which penetrates to the interior higher chain 
not only in tierra del fuego but on the coast for miles
northwards is terminated by tremendous and astonishing glaciers as
described by one of the officers on the survey great masses of ice
frequently fall from these icy cliffs and the crash reverberates like
the broadside of a man-of-war through the lonely channels these
falls as noticed in the last chapter produce great waves which break
on the adjoining coasts it is known that earthquakes frequently cause
masses of earth to fall from sea-cliffs how terrific then would be
the effect of a severe shock and such occur here on a body like
a glacier already in motion and traversed by fissures i can readily
believe that the water would be fairly beaten back out of the deepest
channel and then returning with an overwhelming force would whirl
about huge masses of rock like so much chaff in eyre s sound in the
latitude of paris there are immense glaciers and yet the loftiest
neighbouring mountain is only feet high in this sound about
fifty icebergs were seen at one time floating outwards and one of them
must have been at least feet in total height some of the icebergs
were loaded with blocks of no inconsiderable size of granite and other
rocks different from the clay-slate of the surrounding mountains the
glacier furthest from the pole surveyed during the voyages of the
adventure and beagle is in lat degs in the gulf of penas it
is miles long and in one part broad and descends to the
sea-coast but even a few miles northward of this glacier in laguna
de san

 picture 

rafael some spanish missionaries encountered many icebergs some
great some small and others middle-sized in a narrow arm of the
sea on the nd of the month corresponding with our june and in a
latitude corresponding with that of the lake of geneva 

in europe the most southern glacier which comes down to the sea is met
with according to von buch on the coast of norway in lat degs 
now this is more than degs of latitude or miles nearer the
pole than the laguna de san rafael the position of the glaciers at
this place and in the gulf of penas may be put even in a more striking
point of view for they descend to the sea-coast within degs of
latitude or miles of a harbour where three species of oliva a
voluta and a terebra are the commonest shells within less than 
degs from where palms grow within degs of a region where the
jaguar and puma range over the plains less than degs from
arborescent grasses and looking to the westward in the same
hemisphere less than degs from orchideous parasites and within a
single degree of tree-ferns 

these facts are of high geological interest with respect to the climate
of the northern hemisphere at the period when boulders were
transported i will not here detail how simply the theory of icebergs
being charged with fragments of rock explain the origin and position
of the gigantic boulders of eastern tierra del fuego on the high plain
of santa cruz and on the island of chiloe in tierra del fuego the
greater number of boulders lie on the lines of old sea-channels now
converted into dry valleys by the elevation of the land they are
associated with a great unstratified formation of mud and sand 
containing rounded and angular fragments of all sizes which has
originated in the repeated ploughing up of the sea-bottom by the
stranding of icebergs and by the matter transported on them few
geologists now doubt that those erratic boulders which lie near lofty
mountains have been pushed forward by the glaciers themselves and that
those distant from mountains and embedded in subaqueous deposits have
been conveyed thither either on icebergs or frozen in coast-ice the
connection between the transportal of boulders and the presence of ice
in some form is strikingly shown by their geographical distribution
over the earth in south america they are not found further than 
degs of latitude measured from the southern pole in north america it
appears that the limit of their transportal extends to degs from
the northern pole but in europe to not more than degs of latitude 
measured from the same point on the other hand in the intertropical
parts of america asia and africa they have never been observed nor
at the cape of good hope nor in australia 

on the climate and productions of the antarctic islands considering
the rankness of the vegetation in tierra del fuego and on the coast
northward of it the condition of the islands south and south-west of
america is truly surprising sandwich land in the latitude of the
north part of scotland was found by cook during the hottest month of
the year covered many fathoms thick with everlasting snow and there
seems to be scarcely any vegetation georgia an island miles long
and broad in the latitude of yorkshire in the very height of
summer is in a manner wholly covered with frozen snow it can boast
only of moss some tufts of grass and wild burnet it has only one
land-bird anthus correndera yet iceland which is degs nearer
the pole has according to mackenzie fifteen land-birds the south
shetland islands in the same latitude as the southern half of norway 
possess only some lichens moss and a little grass and lieut kendall
 found the bay in which he was at anchor beginning to freeze at a
period corresponding with our th of september the soil here consists
of ice and volcanic ashes interstratified and at a little depth
beneath the surface it must remain perpetually congealed for lieut 
kendall found the body of a foreign sailor which had long been buried 
with the flesh and all the features perfectly preserved it is a
singular fact that on the two great continents in the northern
hemisphere but not in the broken land of europe between them we
have the zone of perpetually frozen under-soil in a low
latitude namely in degs in north america at the depth of three
feet and in degs in siberia at the depth of twelve to fifteen
feet as the result of a directly opposite condition of things to those
of the southern hemisphere on the northern continents the winter is
rendered excessively cold by the radiation from a large area of land
into a clear sky nor is it moderated by the warmth-bringing currents
of the sea the short summer on the other hand is hot in the
southern ocean the winter is not so excessively cold but the summer is
far less hot for the clouded sky seldom allows the sun to warm the
ocean itself a bad absorbent of heat and hence the mean temperature
of the year which regulates the zone of perpetually congealed
under-soil is low it is evident that a rank vegetation which does
not so much require heat as it does protection from intense cold would
approach much nearer to this zone of perpetual congelation under the
equable climate of the southern hemisphere than under the extreme
climate of the northern continents 

the case of the sailor s body perfectly preserved in the icy soil of
the south shetland islands lat to degs s in a rather lower
latitude than that lat degs n under which pallas found the
frozen rhinoceros in siberia is very interesting although it is a
fallacy as i have endeavoured to show in a former chapter to suppose
that the larger quadrupeds require a luxuriant vegetation for their
support nevertheless it is important to find in the south shetland
islands a frozen under-soil within miles of the forest-clad islands
near cape horn where as far as the bulk of vegetation is concerned 
any number of great quadrupeds might be supported the perfect
preservation of the carcasses of the siberian elephants and
rhinoceroses is certainly one of the most wonderful facts in geology 
but independently of the imagined difficulty of supplying them with
food from the adjoining countries the whole case is not i think so
perplexing as it has generally been considered the plains of siberia 
like those of the pampas appear to have been formed under the sea 
into which rivers brought down the bodies of many animals of the
greater number of these only the skeletons have been preserved but of
others the perfect carcass now it is known that in the shallow sea
on the arctic coast of america the bottom freezes and does not
thaw in spring so soon as the surface of the land moreover at greater
depths where the bottom of the sea does not freeze the mud a few feet
beneath the top layer might remain even in summer below degs as in
the case on the land with the soil at the depth of a few feet at
still greater depths the temperature of the mud and water would
probably not be low enough to preserve the flesh and hence carcasses
drifted beyond the shallow parts near an arctic coast would have only
their skeletons preserved now in the extreme northern parts of siberia
bones are infinitely numerous so that even islets are said to be
almost composed of them and those islets lie no less than ten
degrees of latitude north of the place where pallas found the frozen
rhinoceros on the other hand a carcass washed by a flood into a
shallow part of the arctic sea would be preserved for an indefinite
period if it were soon afterwards covered with mud sufficiently thick
to prevent the heat of the summer-water penetrating to it and if when
the sea-bottom was upraised into land the covering was sufficiently
thick to prevent the heat of the summer air and sun thawing and
corrupting it 

recapitulation i will recapitulate the principal facts with regard to
the climate ice-action and organic productions of the southern
hemisphere transposing the places in imagination to europe with which
we are so much better acquainted then near lisbon the commonest
sea-shells namely three species of oliva a voluta and a terebra 
would have a tropical character in the southern provinces of france 
magnificent forests intwined by arborescent grasses and with the trees
loaded with parasitical plants would hide the face of the land the
puma and the jaguar would haunt the pyrenees in the latitude of mont
blanc but on an island as far westward as central north america 
tree-ferns and parasitical orchideae would thrive amidst the thick
woods even as far north as central denmark humming-birds would be
seen fluttering about delicate flowers and parrots feeding amidst the
evergreen woods and in the sea there we should have a voluta and all
the shells of large size and vigorous growth nevertheless on some
islands only miles northward of our new cape horn in denmark a
carcass buried in the soil or if washed into a shallow sea and
covered up with mud would be preserved perpetually frozen if some
bold navigator attempted to penetrate northward of these islands he
would run a thousand dangers amidst gigantic icebergs on some of which
he would see great blocks of rock borne far away from their original
site another island of large size in the latitude of southern
scotland but twice as far to the west would be almost wholly covered
with everlasting snow and would have each bay terminated by
ice-cliffs whence great masses would be yearly detached this island
would boast only of a little moss grass and burnet and a titlark
would be its only land inhabitant from our new cape horn in denmark 
a chain of mountains scarcely half the height of the alps would run
in a straight line due southward and on its western flank every deep
creek of the sea or fiord would end in bold and astonishing
glaciers these lonely channels would frequently reverberate with the
falls of ice and so often would great waves rush along their coasts 
numerous icebergs some as tall as cathedrals and occasionally loaded
with no inconsiderable blocks of rock would be stranded on the
outlying islets at intervals violent earthquakes would shoot
prodigious masses of ice into the waters below lastly some
missionaries attempting to penetrate a long arm of the sea would
behold the not lofty surrounding mountains sending down their many
grand icy streams to the sea-coast and their progress in the boats
would be checked by the innumerable floating icebergs some small and
some great and this would have occurred on our twenty-second of june

 captain fitz roy informs me that in april our october the leaves
of those trees which grow near the base of the mountains change colour 
but not those on the more elevated parts i remember having read some
observations showing that in england the leaves fall earlier in a warm
and fine autumn than in a late and cold one the change in the colour
being here retarded in the more elevated and therefore colder
situations must be owing to the same general law of vegetation the

are eight or nine species the forms of the greater number being very
peculiar of heteromera four or five species of rhyncophora six or
seven and of the following families one species in each 
staphylinidae elateridae cebrionidae melolonthidae the species in

extreme southern islets near cape horn as far north on the eastern
coast according to information given me by mr stokes as lat 
degs but on the western coast as dr hooker tells me it extends to

thus have an immense range in latitude and as cook who must have been
well acquainted with the species found it at kerguelen land no less

valparaiso excursion to the foot of the andes structure of the

greenstone immense valleys mines state of
miners santiago hot-baths of
cauquenes gold-mines grinding-mills perforated stones habits of the
puma el turco and tapacolo humming-birds 


july rd the beagle anchored late at night in the bay of valparaiso 
the chief seaport of chile when morning came everything appeared
delightful after tierra del fuego the climate felt quite
delicious the atmosphere so dry and the heavens so clear and blue
with the sun shining brightly that all nature seemed sparkling with
life the view from the anchorage is very pretty the town is built
at the very foot of a range of hills about feet high and rather
steep from its position it consists of one long straggling street 
which runs parallel to the beach and wherever a ravine comes down the
houses are piled up on each side of it the rounded hills being only
partially protected by a very scanty vegetation are worn into
numberless little gullies which expose a singularly bright red soil 
from this cause and from the low whitewashed houses with tile roofs 
the view reminded me of st cruz in teneriffe in a north-westerly
direction there are some fine glimpses of the andes but these
mountains appear much grander when viewed from the neighbouring hills 
the great distance at which they are situated can then more readily be
perceived the volcano of aconcagua is particularly magnificent this
huge and irregularly conical mass has an elevation greater than that of
chimborazo for from measurements made by the officers in the beagle 
its height is no less than feet the cordillera however 
viewed from this point owe the greater part of their beauty to the
atmosphere through which they are seen when the sun was setting in
the pacific it was admirable to watch how clearly their rugged
outlines could be distinguished yet how varied and how delicate were
the shades of their colour 

i had the good fortune to find living here mr richard corfield an old
schoolfellow and friend to whose hospitality and kindness i was
greatly indebted in having afforded me a most pleasant residence
during the beagle s stay in chile the immediate neighbourhood of
valparaiso is not very productive to the naturalist during the long
summer the wind blows steadily from the southward and a little off
shore so that rain never falls during the three winter months 
however it is sufficiently abundant the vegetation in consequence is
very scanty except in some deep valleys there are no trees and only
a little grass and a few low bushes are scattered over the less steep
parts of the hills when we reflect that at the distance of miles
to the south this side of the andes is completely hidden by one
impenetrable forest the contrast is very remarkable i took several
long walks while collecting objects of natural history the country is
pleasant for exercise there are many very beautiful flowers and as
in most other dry climates the plants and shrubs possess strong and
peculiar odours even one s clothes by brushing through them became
scented i did not cease from wonder at finding each succeeding day as
fine as the foregoing what a difference does climate make in the
enjoyment of life how opposite are the sensations when viewing black
mountains half enveloped in clouds and seeing another range through
the light blue haze of a fine day the one for a time may be very
sublime the other is all gaiety and happy life 

august th i set out on a riding excursion for the purpose of
geologizing the basal parts of the andes which alone at this time of
the year are not shut up by the winter snow our first day s ride was
northward along the sea-coast after dark we reached the hacienda of
quintero the estate which formerly belonged to lord cochrane my
object in coming here was to see the great beds of shells which stand
some yards above the level of the sea and are burnt for lime the
proofs of the elevation of this whole line of coast are unequivocal at
the height of a few hundred feet old-looking shells are numerous and i
found some at feet these shells either lie loose on the surface 
or are embedded in a reddish-black vegetable mould i was much
surprised to find under the microscope that this vegetable mould is
really marine mud full of minute particles of organic bodies 

th we returned towards the valley of quillota the country was
exceedingly pleasant just such as poets would call pastoral green
open lawns separated by small valleys with rivulets and the cottages 
we may suppose of the shepherds scattered on the hill-sides we were
obliged to cross the ridge of the chilicauquen at its base there were
many fine evergreen forest-trees but these flourished only in the
ravines where there was running water any person who had seen only
the country near valparaiso would never have imagined that there had
been such picturesque spots in chile as soon as we reached the brow of
the sierra the valley of quillota was immediately under our feet the
prospect was one of remarkable artificial luxuriance the valley is
very broad and quite flat and is thus easily irrigated in all parts 
the little square gardens are crowded with orange and olive trees and
every sort of vegetable on each side huge bare mountains rise and
this from the contrast renders the patchwork valley the more pleasing 
whoever called valparaiso the valley of paradise must have been
thinking of quillota we crossed over to the hacienda de san isidro 
situated at the very foot of the bell mountain 

chile as may be seen in the maps is a narrow strip of land between
the cordillera and the pacific and this strip is itself traversed by
several mountain-lines which in this part run parallel to the great
range between these outer lines and the main cordillera a succession
of level basins generally opening into each other by narrow passages 
extend far to the southward in these the principal towns are
situated as san felipe santiago san fernando these basins or
plains together with the transverse flat valleys like that of
quillota which connect them with the coast i have no doubt are the
bottoms of ancient inlets and deep bays such as at the present day
intersect every part of tierra del fuego and the western coast chile
must formerly have resembled the latter country in the configuration of
its land and water the resemblance was occasionally shown strikingly
when a level fog-bank covered as with a mantle all the lower parts of
the country the white vapour curling into the ravines beautifully
represented little coves and bays and here and there a solitary
hillock peeping up showed that it had formerly stood there as an
islet the contrast of these flat valleys and basins with the
irregular mountains gave the scenery a character which to me was new
and very interesting 

from the natural slope to seaward of these plains they are very easily
irrigated and in consequence singularly fertile without this process
the land would produce scarcely anything for during the whole summer
the sky is cloudless the mountains and hills are dotted over with
bushes and low trees and excepting these the vegetation is very
scanty each landowner in the valley possesses a certain portion of
hill-country where his half-wild cattle in considerable numbers 
manage to find sufficient pasture once every year there is a grand
 rodeo when all the cattle are driven down counted and marked and
a certain number separated to be fattened in the irrigated fields 
wheat is extensively cultivated and a good deal of indian corn a kind
of bean is however the staple article of food for the common
labourers the orchards produce an overflowing abundance of peaches
figs and grapes with all these advantages the inhabitants of the
country ought to be much more prosperous than they are 

th the mayor-domo of the hacienda was good enough to give me a
guide and fresh horses and in the morning we set out to ascend the
campana or bell mountain which is feet high the paths were
very bad but both the geology and scenery amply repaid the trouble we
reached by the evening a spring called the agua del guanaco which is
situated at a great height this must be an old name for it is very
many years since a guanaco drank its waters during the ascent i
noticed that nothing but bushes grew on the northern slope whilst on
the southern slope there was a bamboo about fifteen feet high in a
few places there were palms and i was surprised to see one at an
elevation of at least feet these palms are for their family 
ugly trees their stem is very large and of a curious form being
thicker in the middle than at the base or top they are excessively
numerous in some parts of chile and valuable on account of a sort of
treacle made from the sap on one estate near petorca they tried to
count them but failed after having numbered several hundred thousand 
every year in the early spring in august very many are cut down and
when the trunk is lying on the ground the crown of leaves is lopped
off the sap then immediately begins to flow from the upper end and
continues so doing for some months it is however necessary that a
thin slice should be shaved off from that end every morning so as to
expose a fresh surface a good tree will give ninety gallons and all
this must have been contained in the vessels of the apparently dry
trunk it is said that the sap flows much more quickly on those days
when the sun is powerful and likewise that it is absolutely necessary
to take care in cutting down the tree that it should fall with its
head upwards on the side of the hill for if it falls down the slope 
scarcely any sap will flow although in that case one would have
thought that the action would have been aided instead of checked by
the force of gravity the sap is concentrated by boiling and is then
called treacle which it very much resembles in taste 

we unsaddled our horses near the spring and prepared to pass the
night the evening was fine and the atmosphere so clear that the
masts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of valparaiso although no
less than twenty-six geographical miles distant could be distinguished
clearly as little black streaks a ship doubling the point under sail 
appeared as a bright white speck anson expresses much surprise in
his voyage at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from
the coast but he did not sufficiently allow for the height of the
land and the great transparency of the air 

the setting of the sun was glorious the valleys being black whilst the
snowy peaks of the andes yet retained a ruby tint when it was dark 
we made a fire beneath a little arbour of bamboos fried our charqui
 or dried slips of beef took our mate and were quite comfortable 
there is an inexpressible charm in thus living in the open air the
evening was calm and still the shrill noise of the mountain bizcacha 
and the faint cry of a goatsucker were occasionally to be heard 
besides these few birds or even insects frequent these dry parched
mountains 

august th in the morning we climbed up the rough mass of greenstone
which crowns the summit this rock as frequently happens was much
shattered and broken into huge angular fragments i observed however 
one remarkable circumstance namely that many of the surfaces
presented every degree of freshness some appearing as if broken the day
before whilst on others lichens had either just become or had long
grown attached i so fully believed that this was owing to the
frequent earthquakes that i felt inclined to hurry from below each
loose pile as one might very easily be deceived in a fact of this
kind i doubted its accuracy until ascending mount wellington in van
diemen s land where earthquakes do not occur and there i saw the
summit of the mountain similarly composed and similarly shattered but
all the blocks appeared as if they had been hurled into their present
position thousands of years ago 

we spent the day on the summit and i never enjoyed one more
thoroughly chile bounded by the andes and the pacific was seen as
in a map the pleasure from the scenery in itself beautiful was
heightened by the many reflections which arose from the mere view of
the campana range with its lesser parallel ones and of the broad
valley of quillota directly intersecting them who can avoid wondering
at the force which has upheaved these mountains and even more so at
the countless ages which it must have required to have broken through 
removed and levelled whole masses of them it is well in this case to
call to mind the vast shingle and sedimentary beds of patagonia which 
if heaped on the cordillera would increase its height by so many
thousand feet when in that country i wondered how any mountain-chain
could have supplied such masses and not have been utterly obliterated 
we must not now reverse the wonder and doubt whether all-powerful time
can grind down mountains even the gigantic cordillera into-gravel and
mud 

the appearance of the andes was different from that which i had
expected the lower line of the snow was of course horizontal and to
this line the even summits of the range seemed quite parallel only at
long intervals a group of points or a single cone showed where a
volcano had existed or does now exist hence the range resembled a
great solid wall surmounted here and there by a tower and making a
most perfect barrier to the country 

almost every part of the hill had been drilled by attempts to open
gold-mines the rage for mining has left scarcely a spot in chile
unexamined i spent the evening as before talking round the fire with
my two companions the guasos of chile who correspond to the gauchos
of the pampas are however a very different set of beings chile is
the more civilized of the two countries and the inhabitants in
consequence have lost much individual character gradations in rank
are much more strongly marked the guaso does not by any means consider
every man his equal and i was quite surprised to find that my
companions did not like to eat at the same time with myself this
feeling of inequality is a necessary consequence of the existence of an
aristocracy of wealth it is said that some few of the greater
landowners possess from five to ten thousand pounds sterling per annum 
an inequality of riches which i believe is not met with in any of the
cattle-breeding countries eastward of the andes a traveller does not
here meet that unbounded hospitality which refuses all payment but yet
is so kindly offered that no scruples can be raised in accepting it 
almost every house in chile will receive you for the night but a
trifle is expected to be given in the morning even a rich man will
accept two or three shillings the gaucho although he may be a
cutthroat is a gentleman the guaso is in few respects better but at
the same time a vulgar ordinary fellow the two men although
employed much in the same manner are different in their habits and
attire and the peculiarities of each are universal in their respective
countries the gaucho seems part of his horse and scorns to exert
himself except when on his back the guaso may be hired to work as a
labourer in the fields the former lives entirely on animal food the
latter almost wholly on vegetable we do not here see the white boots 
the broad drawers and scarlet chilipa the picturesque costume of the
pampas here common trousers are protected by black and green worsted
leggings the poncho however is common to both the chief pride of
the guaso lies in his spurs which are absurdly large i measured one
which was six inches in the diameter of the rowel and the rowel
itself contained upwards of thirty points the stirrups are on the
same scale each consisting of a square carved block of wood hollowed
out yet weighing three or four pounds the guaso is perhaps more
expert with the lazo than the gaucho but from the nature of the
country he does not know the use of the bolas 

august th we descended the mountain and passed some beautiful
little spots with rivulets and fine trees having slept at the same
hacienda as before we rode during the two succeeding days up the
valley and passed through quillota which is more like a collection of
nursery-gardens than a town the orchards were beautiful presenting
one mass of peach-blossoms i saw also in one or two places the
date-palm it is a most stately tree and i should think a group of
them in their native asiatic or african deserts must be superb we
passed likewise san felipe a pretty straggling town like quillota the
valley in this part expands into one of those great bays or plains 
reaching to the foot of the cordillera which have been mentioned as
forming so curious a part of the scenery of chile in the evening we
reached the mines of jajuel situated in a ravine at the flank of the
great chain i stayed here five days my host the superintendent of
the mine was a shrewd but rather ignorant cornish miner he had
married a spanish woman and did not mean to return home but his
admiration for the mines of cornwall remained unbounded amongst many
other questions he asked me now that george rex is dead how many
more of the family of rexes are yet alive this rex certainly must be
a relation of the great author finis who wrote all books 

these mines are of copper and the ore is all shipped to swansea to be
smelted hence the mines have an aspect singularly quiet as compared
to those in england here no smoke furnaces or great steam-engines 
disturb the solitude of the surrounding mountains 

the chilian government or rather the old spanish law encourages by
every method the searching for mines the discoverer may work a mine
on any ground by paying five shillings and before paying this he may
try even in the garden of another man for twenty days 

it is now well known that the chilian method of mining is the cheapest 
my host says that the two principal improvements introduced by
foreigners have been first reducing by previous roasting the copper
pyrites which being the common ore in cornwall the english miners
were astounded on their arrival to find thrown away as useless 
secondly stamping and washing the scoriae from the old furnaces by
which process particles of metal are recovered in abundance i have
actually seen mules carrying to the coast for transportation to
england a cargo of such cinders but the first case is much the most
curious the chilian miners were so convinced that copper pyrites
contained not a particle of copper that they laughed at the englishmen
for their ignorance who laughed in turn and bought their richest
veins for a few dollars it is very odd that in a country where
mining had been extensively carried on for many years so simple a
process as gently roasting the ore to expel the sulphur previous to
smelting it had never been discovered a few improvements have
likewise been introduced in some of the simple machinery but even to
the present day water is removed from some mines by men carrying it up
the shaft in leathern bags 

the labouring men work very hard they have little time allowed for
their meals and during summer and winter they begin when it is light 
and leave off at dark they are paid one pound sterling a month and
their food is given them this for breakfast consists of sixteen figs
and two small loaves of bread for dinner boiled beans for supper 
broken roasted wheat grain they scarcely ever taste meat as with
the twelve pounds per annum they have to clothe themselves and
support their families the miners who work in the mine itself have
twenty-five shillings per month and are allowed a little charqui but
these men come down from their bleak habitations only once in every
fortnight or three weeks 

during my stay here i thoroughly enjoyed scrambling about these huge
mountains the geology as might have been expected was very
interesting the shattered and baked rocks traversed by innumerable
dykes of greenstone showed what commotions had formerly taken place 
the scenery was much the same as that near the bell of quillota dry
barren mountains dotted at intervals by bushes with a scanty foliage 
the cactuses or rather opuntias were here very numerous i measured
one of a spherical figure which including the spines was six feet
and four inches in circumference the height of the common
cylindrical branching kind is from twelve to fifteen feet and the
girth with spines of the branches between three and four feet 

a heavy fall of snow on the mountains prevented me during the last two
days from making some interesting excursions i attempted to reach a
lake which the inhabitants from some unaccountable reason believe to
be an arm of the sea during a very dry season it was proposed to
attempt cutting a channel from it for the sake of the water but the
padre after a consultation declared it was too dangerous as all
chile would be inundated if as generally supposed the lake was
connected with the pacific we ascended to a great height but
becoming involved in the snow-drifts failed in reaching this wonderful
lake and had some difficulty in returning i thought we should have
lost our horses for there was no means of guessing how deep the drifts
were and the animals when led could only move by jumping the black
sky showed that a fresh snow-storm was gathering and we therefore were
not a little glad when we escaped by the time we reached the base the
storm commenced and it was lucky for us that this did not happen three
hours earlier in the day 

august th we left jajuel and again crossed the basin of san felipe 
the day was truly chilian glaringly bright and the atmosphere quite
clear the thick and uniform covering of newly fallen snow rendered
the view of the volcano of aconcagua and the main chain quite glorious 
we were now on the road to santiago the capital of chile we crossed
the cerro del talguen and slept at a little rancho the host talking
about the state of chile as compared to other countries was very
humble some see with two eyes and some with one but for my part i
do not think that chile sees with any 

august th after crossing many low hills we descended into the small
land-locked plain of guitron in the basins such as this one which
are elevated from one thousand to two thousand feet above the sea two
species of acacia which are stunted in their forms and stand wide
apart from each other grow in large numbers these trees are never
found near the sea-coast and this gives another characteristic feature
to the scenery of these basins we crossed a low ridge which separates
guitron from the great plain on which santiago stands the view was
here pre-eminently striking the dead level surface covered in parts
by woods of acacia and with the city in the distance abutting
horizontally against the base of the andes whose snowy peaks were
bright with the evening sun at the first glance of this view it was
quite evident that the plain represented the extent of a former inland
sea as soon as we gained the level road we pushed our horses into a
gallop and reached the city before it was dark 

i stayed a week in santiago and enjoyed myself very much in the
morning i rode to various places on the plain and in the evening dined
with several of the english merchants whose hospitality at this place
is well known a never-failing source of pleasure was to ascend the
little hillock of rock st lucia which projects in the middle of the
city the scenery certainly is most striking and as i have said 
very peculiar i am informed that this same character is common to the
cities on the great mexican platform of the town i have nothing to
say in detail it is not so fine or so large as buenos ayres but is
built after the same model i arrived here by a circuit to the north 
so i resolved to return to valparaiso by a rather longer excursion to
the south of the direct road 

september th by the middle of the day we arrived at one of the
suspension bridges made of hide which cross the maypu a large
turbulent river a few leagues southward of santiago these bridges are
very poor affairs the road following the curvature of the suspending
ropes is made of bundles of sticks placed close together it was full
of holes and oscillated rather fearfully even with the weight of a
man leading his horse in the evening we reached a comfortable
farm-house where there were several very pretty senoritas they were
much horrified at my having entered one of their churches out of mere
curiosity they asked me why do you not become a christian for our
religion is certain i assured them i was a sort of christian but
they would not hear of it appealing to my own words do not your
padres your very bishops marry the absurdity of a bishop having a
wife particularly struck them they scarcely knew whether to be most
amused or horror-struck at such an enormity 

th we proceeded due south and slept at rancagua the road passed
over the level but narrow plain bounded on one side by lofty hills 
and on the other by the cordillera the next day we turned up the
valley of the rio cachapual in which the hot-baths of cauquenes long
celebrated for their medicinal properties are situated the
suspension bridges in the less frequented parts are generally taken
down during the winter when the rivers are low such was the case in
this valley and we were therefore obliged to cross the stream on
horseback this is rather disagreeable for the foaming water though
not deep rushes so quickly over the bed of large rounded stones that
one s head becomes quite confused and it is difficult even to perceive
whether the horse is moving onward or standing still in summer when
the snow melts the torrents are quite impassable their strength and
fury are then extremely great as might be plainly seen by the marks
which they had left we reached the baths in the evening and stayed
there five days being confined the two last by heavy rain the
buildings consist of a square of miserable little hovels each with a
single table and bench they are situated in a narrow deep valley just
without the central cordillera it is a quiet solitary spot with a
good deal of wild beauty 

the mineral springs of cauquenes burst forth on a line of dislocation 
crossing a mass of stratified rock the whole of which betrays the
action of heat a considerable quantity of gas is continually escaping
from the same orifices with the water though the springs are only a
few yards apart they have very different temperature and this appears
to be the result of an unequal mixture of cold water for those with
the lowest temperature have scarcely any mineral taste after the great
earthquake of the springs ceased and the water did not return for
nearly a year they were also much affected by the earthquake of 
the temperature being suddenly changed from to degs it
seems probable that mineral waters rising deep from the bowels of the
earth would always be more deranged by subterranean disturbances than
those nearer the surface the man who had charge of the baths assured
me that in summer the water is hotter and more plentiful than in
winter the former circumstance i should have expected from the less
mixture during the dry season of cold water but the latter statement
appears very strange and contradictory the periodical increase during
the summer when rain never falls can i think only be accounted for
by the melting of the snow yet the mountains which are covered by snow
during that season are three or four leagues distant from the springs 
i have no reason to doubt the accuracy of my informer who having
lived on the spot for several years ought to be well acquainted with
the circumstance which if true certainly is very curious for we
must suppose that the snow-water being conducted through porous strata
to the regions of heat is again thrown up to the surface by the line
of dislocated and injected rocks at cauquenes and the regularity of
the phenomenon would seem to indicate that in this district heated rock
occurred at a depth not very great 

one day i rode up the valley to the farthest inhabited spot shortly
above that point the cachapual divides into two deep tremendous
ravines which penetrate directly into the great range i scrambled up
a peaked mountain probably more than six thousand feet high here as
indeed everywhere else scenes of the highest interest presented
themselves it was by one of these ravines that pincheira entered
chile and ravaged the neighbouring country this is the same man whose
attack on an estancia at the rio negro i have described he was a
renegade half-caste spaniard who collected a great body of indians
together and established himself by a stream in the pampas which place
none of the forces sent after him could ever discover from this point
he used to sally forth and crossing the cordillera by passes hitherto
unattempted he ravaged the farm-houses and drove the cattle to his
secret rendezvous pincheira was a capital horseman and he made all
around him equally good for he invariably shot any one who hesitated
to follow him it was against this man and other wandering indian
tribes that rosas waged the war of extermination 

september th we left the baths of cauquenes and rejoining the
main road slept at the rio clara from this place we rode to the town
of san fernando before arriving there the last land-locked basin had
expanded into a great plain which extended so far to the south that
the snowy summits of the more distant andes were seen as if above the
horizon of the sea san fernando is forty leagues from santiago and
it was my farthest point southward for we here turned at right angles
towards the coast we slept at the gold-mines of yaquil which are
worked by mr nixon an american gentleman to whose kindness i was
much indebted during the four days i stayed at his house the next
morning we rode to the mines which are situated at the distance of
some leagues near the summit of a lofty hill on the way we had a
glimpse of the lake tagua-tagua celebrated for its floating islands 
which have been described by m gay they are composed of the
stalks of various dead plants intertwined together and on the surface
of which other living ones take root their form is generally
circular and their thickness from four to six feet of which the
greater part is immersed in the water as the wind blows they pass
from one side of the lake to the other and often carry cattle and
horses as passengers 

when we arrived at the mine i was struck by the pale appearance of
many of the men and inquired from mr nixon respecting their
condition the mine is feet deep and each man brings up about 
pounds weight of stone with this load they have to climb up the
alternate notches cut in the trunks of trees placed in a zigzag line
up the shaft even beardless young men eighteen and twenty years old 
with little muscular development of their bodies they are quite naked
excepting drawers ascend with this great load from nearly the same
depth a strong man who is not accustomed to this labour perspires
most profusely with merely carrying up his own body with this very
severe labour they live entirely on boiled beans and bread they
would prefer having bread alone but their masters finding that they
cannot work so hard upon this treat them like horses and make them
eat the beans their pay is here rather more than at the mines of
jajuel being from to shillings per month they leave the mine
only once in three weeks when they stay with their families for two
days one of the rules of this mine sounds very harsh but answers
pretty well for the master the only method of stealing gold is to
secrete pieces of the ore and take them out as occasion may offer 
whenever the major-domo finds a lump thus hidden its full value is
stopped out of the wages of all the men who thus without they all
combine are obliged to keep watch over each other 

when the ore is brought to the mill it is ground into an impalpable
powder the process of washing removes all the lighter particles and
amalgamation finally secures the gold-dust the washing when
described sounds a very simple process but it is beautiful to see how
the exact adaptation of the current of water to the specific gravity of
the gold so easily separates the powdered matrix from the metal the
mud which passes from the mills is collected into pools where it
subsides and every now and then is cleared out and thrown into a
common heap a great deal of chemical action then commences salts of
various kinds effloresce on the surface and the mass becomes hard 
after having been left for a year or two and then rewashed it yields
gold and this process may be repeated even six or seven times but the
gold each time becomes less in quantity and the intervals required as
the inhabitants say to generate the metal are longer there can be
no doubt that the chemical action already mentioned each time
liberates fresh gold from some combination the discovery of a method
to effect this before the first grinding would without doubt raise the
value of gold-ores many fold 

it is curious to find how the minute particles of gold being scattered
about and not corroding at last accumulate in some quantity a short
time since a few miners being out of work obtained permission to
scrape the ground round the house and mills they washed the earth thus
got together and so procured thirty dollars worth of gold this is
an exact counterpart of what takes place in nature mountains suffer
degradation and wear away and with them the metallic veins which they
contain the hardest rock is worn into impalpable mud the ordinary
metals oxidate and both are removed but gold platina and a few
others are nearly indestructible and from their weight sinking to the
bottom are left behind after whole mountains have passed through this
grinding mill and have been washed by the hand of nature the residue
becomes metalliferous and man finds it worth his while to complete the
task of separation 

bad as the above treatment of the miners appears it is gladly accepted
of by them for the condition of the labouring agriculturists is much
worse their wages are lower and they live almost exclusively on
beans this poverty must be chiefly owing to the feudal-like system on
which the land is tilled the landowner gives a small plot of ground to
the labourer for building on and cultivating and in return has his
services or those of a proxy for every day of his life without any
wages until a father has a grown-up son who can by his labour pay
the rent there is no one except on occasional days to take care of
his own patch of ground hence extreme poverty is very common among the
labouring classes in this country 

there are some old indian ruins in this neighbourhood and i was shown
one of the perforated stones which molina mentions as being found in
many places in considerable numbers they are of a circular flattened
form from five to six inches in diameter with a hole passing quite
through the centre it has generally been supposed that they were used
as heads to clubs although their form does not appear at all well
adapted for that purpose burchell states that some of the tribes
in southern africa dig up roots by the aid of a stick pointed at one
end the force and weight of which are increased by a round stone with
a hole in it into which the other end is firmly wedged it appears
probable that the indians of chile formerly used some such rude
agricultural instrument 

one day a german collector in natural history of the name of renous 
called and nearly at the same time an old spanish lawyer i was
amused at being told the conversation which took place between them 
renous speaks spanish so well that the old lawyer mistook him for a
chilian renous alluding to me asked him what he thought of the king
of england sending out a collector to their country to pick up lizards
and beetles and to break stones the old gentleman thought seriously
for some time and then said it is not well hay un gato encerrado
aqui there is a cat shut up here no man is so rich as to send out
people to pick up such rubbish i do not like it if one of us were to
go and do such things in england do not you think the king of england
would very soon send us out of his country and this old gentleman 
from his profession belongs to the better informed and more
intelligent classes renous himself two or three years before left
in a house at san fernando some caterpillars under charge of a girl to
feed that they might turn into butterflies this was rumoured through
the town and at last the padres and governor consulted together and
agreed it must be some heresy accordingly when renous returned he
was arrested 

september th we left yaquil and followed the flat valley formed
like that of quillota in which the rio tinderidica flows even at
these few miles south of santiago the climate is much damper in
consequence there are fine tracts of pasturage which are not
irrigated th we followed this valley till it expanded into a
great plain which reaches from the sea to the mountains west of
rancagua we shortly lost all trees and even bushes so that the
inhabitants are nearly as badly off for firewood as those in the
pampas never having heard of these plains i was much surprised at
meeting with such scenery in chile the plains belong to more than one
series of different elevations and they are traversed by broad
flat-bottomed valleys both of which circumstances as in patagonia 
bespeak the action of the sea on gently rising land in the steep
cliffs bordering these valleys there are some large caves which no
doubt were originally formed by the waves one of these is celebrated
under the name of cueva del obispo having formerly been consecrated 
during the day i felt very unwell and from that time till the end of
october did not recover 

september nd we continued to pass over green plains without a tree 
the next day we arrived at a house near navedad on the sea-coast 
where a rich haciendero gave us lodgings i stayed here the two
ensuing days and although very unwell managed to collect from the
tertiary formation some marine shells 

th our course was now directed towards valparaiso which with great
difficulty i reached on the th and was there confined to my bed till
the end of october during this time i was an inmate in mr corfield s
house whose kindness to me i do not know how to express 


i will here add a few observations on some of the animals and birds of
chile the puma or south american lion is not uncommon this animal
has a wide geographical range being found from the equatorial forests 
throughout the deserts of patagonia as far south as the damp and cold
latitudes to degs of tierra del fuego i have seen its
footsteps in the cordillera of central chile at an elevation of at
least feet in la plata the puma preys chiefly on deer 
ostriches bizcacha and other small quadrupeds it there seldom
attacks cattle or horses and most rarely man in chile however it
destroys many young horses and cattle owing probably to the scarcity
of other quadrupeds i heard likewise of two men and a woman who had
been thus killed it is asserted that the puma always kills its prey by
springing on the shoulders and then drawing back the head with one of
its paws until the vertebrae break i have seen in patagonia the
skeletons of guanacos with their necks thus dislocated 

the puma after eating its fill covers the carcass with many large
bushes and lies down to watch it this habit is often the cause of
its being discovered for the condors wheeling in the air every now and
then descend to partake of the feast and being angrily driven away 
rise all together on the wing the chileno guaso then knows there is a
lion watching his prey the word is given and men and dogs hurry to
the chase sir f head says that a gaucho in the pampas upon merely
seeing some condors wheeling in the air cried a lion i could never
myself meet with any one who pretended to such powers of
discrimination it is asserted that if a puma has once been betrayed
by thus watching the carcass and has then been hunted it never
resumes this habit but that having gorged itself it wanders far
away the puma is easily killed in an open country it is first
entangled with the bolas then lazoed and dragged along the ground
till rendered insensible at tandeel south of the plata i was told
that within three months one hundred were thus destroyed in chile
they are generally driven up bushes or trees and are then either shot 
or baited to death by dogs the dogs employed in this chase belong to
a particular breed called leoneros they are weak slight animals 
like long-legged terriers but are born with a particular instinct for
this sport the puma is described as being very crafty when pursued 
it often returns on its former track and then suddenly making a spring
on one side waits there till the dogs have passed by it is a very
silent animal uttering no cry even when wounded and only rarely
during the breeding season 

of birds two species of the genus pteroptochos megapodius and
albicollis of kittlitz are perhaps the most conspicuous the former 
called by the chilenos el turco is as large as a fieldfare to which
bird it has some alliance but its legs are much longer tail shorter 
and beak stronger its colour is a reddish brown the turco is not
uncommon it lives on the ground sheltered among the thickets which
are scattered over the dry and sterile hills with its tail erect and
stilt-like legs it may be seen every now and then popping from one
bush to another with uncommon quickness it really requires little
imagination to believe that the bird is ashamed of itself and is aware
of its most ridiculous figure on first seeing it one is tempted to
exclaim a vilely stuffed specimen has escaped from some museum and
has come to life again it cannot be made to take flight without the
greatest trouble nor does it run but only hops the various loud
cries which it utters when concealed amongst the bushes are as strange
as its appearance it is said to build its nest in a deep hole beneath
the ground i dissected several specimens the gizzard which was very
muscular contained beetles vegetable fibres and pebbles from this
character from the length of its legs scratching feet membranous
covering to the nostrils short and arched wings this bird seems in a
certain degree to connect the thrushes with the gallinaceous order 

the second species or p albicollis is allied to the first in its
general form it is called tapacolo or cover your posterior and
well does the shameless little bird deserve its name for it carries
its tail more than erect that is inclined backwards towards its head 
it is very common and frequents the bottoms of hedge-rows and the
bushes scattered over the barren hills where scarcely another bird can
exist in its general manner of feeding of quickly hopping out of the
thickets and back again in its desire of concealment unwillingness to
take flight and nidification it bears a close resemblance to the
turco but its appearance is not quite so ridiculous the tapacolo is
very crafty when frightened by any person it will remain motionless
at the bottom of a bush and will then after a little while try with
much address to crawl away on the opposite side it is also an active
bird and continually making a noise these noises are various and
strangely odd some are like the cooing of doves others like the
bubbling of water and many defy all similes the country people say
it changes its cry five times in the year according to some change of
season i suppose 

two species of humming-birds are common trochilus forficatus is found
over a space of miles on the west coast from the hot dry country
of lima to the forests of tierra del fuego where it may be seen
flitting about in snow-storms in the wooded island of chiloe which
has an extremely humid climate this little bird skipping from side to
side amidst the dripping foliage is perhaps more abundant than almost
any other kind i opened the stomachs of several specimens shot in
different parts of the continent and in all remains of insects were
as numerous as in the stomach of a creeper when this species migrates
in the summer southward it is replaced by the arrival of another
species coming from the north this second kind trochilus gigas is a
very large bird for the delicate family to which it belongs when on
the wing its appearance is singular like others of the genus it
moves from place to place with a rapidity which may be compared to that
of syrphus amongst flies and sphinx among moths but whilst hovering
over a flower it flaps its wings with a very slow and powerful
movement totally different from that vibratory one common to most of
the species which produces the humming noise i never saw any other
bird where the force of its wings appeared as in a butterfly so
powerful in proportion to the weight of its body when hovering by a
flower its tail is constantly expanded and shut like a fan the body
being kept in a nearly vertical position this action appears to
steady and support the bird between the slow movements of its wings 
although flying from flower to flower in search of food its stomach
generally contained abundant remains of insects which i suspect are
much more the object of its search than honey the note of this
species like that of nearly the whole family is extremely shrill

 it is a remarkable fact that molina though describing in detail
all the birds and animals of chile never once mentions this genus the
species of which are so common and so remarkable in their habits was
he at a loss how to classify them and did he consequently think that
silence was the more prudent course it is one more instance of the
frequency of omissions by authors on those very subjects where it
might have been least expected

chiloe and chonos islands

chiloe general aspect boat excursion native indians castro tame

montes granitic range boat-wrecked sailors low s harbour wild
potato formation of peat myopotamus otter and mice cheucau and
barking-bird opetiorhynchus singular character of
ornithology petrels 


november th the beagle sailed from valparaiso to the south for the
purpose of surveying the southern part of chile the island of chiloe 
and the broken land called the chonos archipelago as far south as the
peninsula of tres montes on the st we anchored in the bay of s 
carlos the capital of chiloe 

this island is about ninety miles long with a breadth of rather less
than thirty the land is hilly but not mountainous and is covered by
one great forest except where a few green patches have been cleared
round the thatched cottages from a distance the view somewhat
resembles that of tierra del fuego but the woods when seen nearer 
are incomparably more beautiful many kinds of fine evergreen trees 
and plants with a tropical character here take the place of the gloomy
beech of the southern shores in winter the climate is detestable and
in summer it is only a little better i should think there are few
parts of the world within the temperate regions where so much rain
falls the winds are very boisterous and the sky almost always
clouded to have a week of fine weather is something wonderful it is
even difficult to get a single glimpse of the cordillera during our
first visit once only the volcano of osorno stood out in bold relief 
and that was before sunrise it was curious to watch as the sun rose 
the outline gradually fading away in the glare of the eastern sky 

the inhabitants from their complexion and low stature appear to have
three-fourths of indian blood in their veins they are an humble 
quiet industrious set of men although the fertile soil resulting
from the decomposition of the volcanic rocks supports a rank
vegetation yet the climate is not favourable to any production which
requires much sunshine to ripen it there is very little pasture for
the larger quadrupeds and in consequence the staple articles of food
are pigs potatoes and fish the people all dress in strong woollen
garments which each family makes for itself and dyes with indigo of a
dark blue colour the arts however are in the rudest state as may
be seen in their strange fashion of ploughing their method of
spinning grinding corn and in the construction of their boats the
forests are so impenetrable that the land is nowhere cultivated except
near the coast and on the adjoining islets even where paths exist 
they are scarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil 
the inhabitants like those of tierra del fuego move about chiefly on
the beach or in boats although with plenty to eat the people are
very poor there is no demand for labour and consequently the lower
orders cannot scrape together money sufficient to purchase even the
smallest luxuries there is also a great deficiency of a circulating
medium i have seen a man bringing on his back a bag of charcoal with
which to buy some trifle and another carrying a plank to exchange for
a bottle of wine hence every tradesman must also be a merchant and
again sell the goods which he takes in exchange 

november th the yawl and whale-boat were sent under the command of
mr now captain sulivan to survey the eastern or inland coast of
chiloe and with orders to meet the beagle at the southern extremity of
the island to which point she would proceed by the outside so as thus
to circumnavigate the whole i accompanied this expedition but
instead of going in the boats the first day i hired horses to take me
to chacao at the northern extremity of the island the road followed
the coast every now and then crossing promontories covered by fine
forests in these shaded paths it is absolutely necessary that the
whole road should be made of logs of wood which are squared and placed
by the side of each other from the rays of the sun never penetrating
the evergreen foliage the ground is so damp and soft that except by
this means neither man nor horse would be able to pass along i
arrived at the village of chacao shortly after the tents belonging to
the boats were pitched for the night 

the land in this neighbourhood has been extensively cleared and there
were many quiet and most picturesque nooks in the forest chacao was
formerly the principal port in the island but many vessels having been
lost owing to the dangerous currents and rocks in the straits the
spanish government burnt the church and thus arbitrarily compelled the
greater number of inhabitants to migrate to s carlos we had not long
bivouacked before the barefooted son of the governor came down to
reconnoitre us seeing the english flag hoisted at the yawl s
mast-head he asked with the utmost indifference whether it was always
to fly at chacao in several places the inhabitants were much
astonished at the appearance of men-of-war s boats and hoped and
believed it was the forerunner of a spanish fleet coming to recover
the island from the patriot government of chile all the men in power 
however had been informed of our intended visit and were exceedingly
civil while we were eating our supper the governor paid us a visit 
he had been a lieutenant-colonel in the spanish service but now was
miserably poor he gave us two sheep and accepted in return two
cotton handkerchiefs some brass trinkets and a little tobacco 

th torrents of rain we managed however to run down the coast as
far as huapi-lenou the whole of this eastern side of chiloe has one
aspect it is a plain broken by valleys and divided into little
islands and the whole thickly covered with one impervious
blackish-green forest on the margins there are some cleared spaces 
surrounding the high-roofed cottages 

th the day rose splendidly clear the volcano of orsono was
spouting out volumes of smoke this most beautiful mountain formed
like a perfect cone and white with snow stands out in front of the
cordillera another great volcano with a saddle-shaped summit also
emitted from its immense crater little jets of steam subsequently we
saw the lofty-peaked corcovado well deserving the name of el famoso
corcovado thus we beheld from one point of view three great active
volcanoes each about seven thousand feet high in addition to this 
far to the south there were other lofty cones covered with snow 
which although not known to be active must be in their origin
volcanic the line of the andes is not in this neighbourhood nearly
so elevated as in chile neither does it appear to form so perfect a
barrier between the regions of the earth this great range although
running in a straight north and south line owing to an optical
deception always appeared more or less curved for the lines drawn
from each peak to the beholder s eye necessarily converged like the
radii of a semicircle and as it was not possible owing to the
clearness of the atmosphere and the absence of all intermediate
objects to judge how far distant the farthest peaks were off they
appeared to stand in a flattish semicircle 

landing at midday we saw a family of pure indian extraction the
father was singularly like york minster and some of the younger boys 
with their ruddy complexions might have been mistaken for pampas
indians everything i have seen convinces me of the close connexion
of the different american tribes who nevertheless speak distinct
languages this party could muster but little spanish and talked to
each other in their own tongue it is a pleasant thing to see the
aborigines advanced to the same degree of civilization however low
that may be which their white conquerors have attained more to the
south we saw many pure indians indeed all the inhabitants of some of
the islets retain their indian surnames in the census of there
were in chiloe and its dependencies forty-two thousand souls the
greater number of these appear to be of mixed blood eleven thousand
retain their indian surnames but it is probable that not nearly all of
these are of a pure breed their manner of life is the same with that
of the other poor inhabitants and they are all christians but it is
said that they yet retain some strange superstitious ceremonies and
that they pretend to hold communication with the devil in certain
caves formerly every one convicted of this offence was sent to the
inquisition at lima many of the inhabitants who are not included in
the eleven thousand with indian surnames cannot be distinguished by
their appearance from indians gomez the governor of lemuy is
descended from noblemen of spain on both sides but by constant
intermarriages with the natives the present man is an indian on the
other hand the governor of quinchao boasts much of his purely kept
spanish blood 

we reached at night a beautiful little cove north of the island of
caucahue the people here complained of want of land this is partly
owing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods and partly to
restrictions by the government which makes it necessary before buying
ever so small a piece to pay two shillings to the surveyor for
measuring each quadra yards square together with whatever price
he fixes for the value of the land after his valuation the land must
be put up three times to auction and if no one bids more the
purchaser can have it at that rate all these exactions must be a
serious check to clearing the ground where the inhabitants are so
extremely poor in most countries forests are removed without much
difficulty by the aid of fire but in chiloe from the damp nature of
the climate and the sort of trees it is necessary first to cut them
down this is a heavy drawback to the prosperity of chiloe in the
time of the spaniards the indians could not hold land and a family 
after having cleared a piece of ground might be driven away and the
property seized by the government the chilian authorities are now
performing an act of justice by making retribution to these poor
indians giving to each man according to his grade of life a certain
portion of land the value of uncleared ground is very little the
government gave mr douglas the present surveyor who informed me of
these circumstances eight and a half square miles of forest near s 
carlos in lieu of a debt and this he sold for dollars or about
 pounds sterling 

the two succeeding days were fine and at night we reached the island
of quinchao this neighbourhood is the most cultivated part of the
archipelago for a broad strip of land on the coast of the main island 
as well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones is almost completely
cleared some of the farm-houses seemed very comfortable i was
curious to ascertain how rich any of these people might be but mr 
douglas says that no one can be considered as possessing a regular
income one of the richest landowners might possibly accumulate in a
long industrious life as much as pounds sterling but should this
happen it would all be stowed away in some secret corner for it is
the custom of almost every family to have a jar or treasure-chest
buried in the ground 

november th early on sunday morning we reached castro the ancient
capital of chiloe but now a most forlorn and deserted place the usual
quadrangular arrangement of spanish towns could be traced but the
streets and plaza were coated with fine green turf on which sheep were
browsing the church which stands in the middle is entirely built of
plank and has a picturesque and venerable appearance the poverty of
the place may be conceived from the fact that although containing some
hundreds of inhabitants one of our party was unable anywhere to
purchase either a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife no individual
possessed either a watch or a clock and an old man who was supposed
to have a good idea of time was employed to strike the church bell by
guess the arrival of our boats was a rare event in this quiet retired
corner of the world and nearly all the inhabitants came down to the
beach to see us pitch our tents they were very civil and offered us
a house and one man even sent us a cask of cider as a present in the
afternoon we paid our respects to the governor a quiet old man who 
in his appearance and manner of life was scarcely superior to an
english cottager at night heavy rain set in which was hardly
sufficient to drive away from our tents the large circle of lookers-on 
an indian family who had come to trade in a canoe from caylen 
bivouacked near us they had no shelter during the rain in the
morning i asked a young indian who was wet to the skin how he had
passed the night he seemed perfectly content and answered muy
bien senor 

december st we steered for the island of lemuy i was anxious to
examine a reported coal-mine which turned out to be lignite of little
value in the sandstone probably of an ancient tertiary epoch of
which these islands are composed when we reached lemuy we had much
difficulty in finding any place to pitch our tents for it was
spring-tide and the land was wooded down to the water s edge in a
short time we were surrounded by a large group of the nearly pure
indian inhabitants they were much surprised at our arrival and said
one to the other this is the reason we have seen so many parrots
lately the cheucau an odd red-breasted little bird which inhabits
the thick forest and utters very peculiar noises has not cried
 beware for nothing they were soon anxious for barter money was
scarcely worth anything but their eagerness for tobacco was something
quite extraordinary after tobacco indigo came next in value then
capsicum old clothes and gunpowder the latter article was required
for a very innocent purpose each parish has a public musket and the
gunpowder was wanted for making a noise on their saint or feast days 

the people here live chiefly on shell-fish and potatoes at certain
seasons they catch also in corrales or hedges under water many
fish which are left on the mud-banks as the tide falls they
occasionally possess fowls sheep goats pigs horses and cattle the
order in which they are here mentioned expressing their respective
numbers i never saw anything more obliging and humble than the
manners of these people they generally began with stating that they
were poor natives of the place and not spaniards and that they were in
sad want of tobacco and other comforts at caylen the most southern
island the sailors bought with a stick of tobacco of the value of
three-halfpence two fowls one of which the indian stated had skin
between its toes and turned out to be a fine duck and with some
cotton handkerchiefs worth three shillings three sheep and a large
bunch of onions were procured the yawl at this place was anchored
some way from the shore and we had fears for her safety from robbers
during the night our pilot mr douglas accordingly told the
constable of the district that we always placed sentinels with loaded
arms and not understanding spanish if we saw any person in the dark 
we should assuredly shoot him the constable with much humility 
agreed to the perfect propriety of this arrangement and promised us
that no one should stir out of his house during that night 

during the four succeeding days we continued sailing southward the
general features of the country remained the same but it was much less
thickly inhabited on the large island of tanqui there was scarcely
one cleared spot the trees on every side extending their branches over
the sea-beach i one day noticed growing on the sandstone cliffs 
some very fine plants of the panke gunnera scabra which somewhat
resembles the rhubarb on a gigantic scale the inhabitants eat the
stalks which are subacid and tan leather with the roots and prepare
a black dye from them the leaf is nearly circular but deeply indented
on its margin i measured one which was nearly eight feet in diameter 
and therefore no less than twenty-four in circumference the stalk is
rather more than a yard high and each plant sends out four or five of
these enormous leaves presenting together a very noble appearance 

december th we reached caylen called el fin del cristiandad in
the morning we stopped for a few minutes at a house on the northern end
of laylec which was the extreme point of south american christendom 
and a miserable hovel it was the latitude is degs which is
two degrees farther south than the rio negro on the atlantic coast 
these extreme christians were very poor and under the plea of their
situation begged for some tobacco as a proof of the poverty of these
indians i may mention that shortly before this we had met a man who
had travelled three days and a half on foot and had as many to return 
for the sake of recovering the value of a small axe and a few fish how
very difficult it must be to buy the smallest article when such
trouble is taken to recover so small a debt 

in the evening we reached the island of san pedro where we found the
beagle at anchor in doubling the point two of the officers landed to
take a round of angles with the theodolite a fox canis fulvipes of
a kind said to be peculiar to the island and very rare in it and
which is a new species was sitting on the rocks he was so intently
absorbed in watching the work of the officers that i was able by
quietly walking up behind to knock him on the head with my geological
hammer this fox more curious or more scientific but less wise than
the generality of his brethren is now mounted in the museum of the
zoological society 

we stayed three days in this harbour on one of which captain fitz
roy with a party attempted to ascend to the summit of san pedro the
woods here had rather a different appearance from those on the northern
part of the island the rock also being micaceous slate there was no
beach but the steep sides dipped directly beneath the water the
general aspect in consequence was more like that of tierra del fuego
than of chiloe in vain we tried to gain the summit the forest was so
impenetrable that no one who has not beheld it can imagine so
entangled a mass of dying and dead trunks i am sure that often for
more than ten minutes together our feet never touched the ground and
we were frequently ten or fifteen feet above it so that the seamen as
a joke called out the soundings at other times we crept one after
another on our hands and knees under the rotten trunks in the lower
part of the mountain noble trees of the winter s bark and a laurel
like the sassafras with fragrant leaves and others the names of which
i do not know were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane here
we were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal on
the higher parts brushwood takes the place of larger trees with here
and there a red cedar or an alerce pine i was also pleased to see at
an elevation of a little less than feet our old friend the
southern beech they were however poor stunted trees and i should
think that this must be nearly their northern limit we ultimately
gave up the attempt in despair 

december th the yawl and whale-boat with mr sulivan proceeded on
their survey but i remained on board the beagle which the next day
left san pedro for the southward on the th we ran into an opening in
the southern part of guayatecas or the chonos archipelago and it was
fortunate we did so for on the following day a storm worthy of tierra
del fuego raged with great fury white massive clouds were piled up
against a dark blue sky and across them black ragged sheets of vapour
were rapidly driven the successive mountain ranges appeared like dim
shadows and the setting sun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam much
like that produced by the flame of spirits of wine the water was
white with the flying spray and the wind lulled and roared again
through the rigging it was an ominous sublime scene during a few
minutes there was a bright rainbow and it was curious to observe the
effect of the spray which being carried along the surface of the
water changed the ordinary semicircle into a circle a band of
prismatic colours being continued from both feet of the common arch
across the bay close to the vessel s side thus forming a distorted 
but very nearly entire ring 

we stayed here three days the weather continued bad but this did not
much signify for the surface of the land in all these islands is all
but impassable the coast is so very rugged that to attempt to walk in
that direction requires continued scrambling up and down over the sharp
rocks of mica-slate and as for the woods our faces hands and
shin-bones all bore witness to the maltreatment we received in merely
attempting to penetrate their forbidden recesses 

december th we stood out to sea on the th we bade farewell to
the south and with a fair wind turned the ship s head northward from
cape tres montes we sailed pleasantly along the lofty weather-beaten
coast which is remarkable for the bold outline of its hills and the
thick covering of forest even on the almost precipitous flanks the
next day a harbour was discovered which on this dangerous coast might
be of great service to a distressed vessel it can easily be
recognized by a hill feet high which is even more perfectly
conical than the famous sugar-loaf at rio de janeiro the next day 
after anchoring i succeeded in reaching the summit of this hill it
was a laborious undertaking for the sides were so steep that in some
parts it was necessary to use the trees as ladders there were also
several extensive brakes of the fuchsia covered with its beautiful
drooping flowers but very difficult to crawl through in these wild
countries it gives much delight to gain the summit of any mountain 
there is an indefinite expectation of seeing something very strange 
which however often it may be balked never failed with me to recur on
each successive attempt every one must know the feeling of triumph
and pride which a grand view from a height communicates to the mind in
these little frequented countries there is also joined to it some
vanity that you perhaps are the first man who ever stood on this
pinnacle or admired this view 

a strong desire is always felt to ascertain whether any human being has
previously visited an unfrequented spot a bit of wood with a nail in
it is picked up and studied as if it were covered with hieroglyphics 
possessed with this feeling i was much interested by finding on a
wild part of the coast a bed made of grass beneath a ledge of rock 
close by it there had been a fire and the man had used an axe the
fire bed and situation showed the dexterity of an indian but he
could scarcely have been an indian for the race is in this part
extinct owing to the catholic desire of making at one blow christians
and slaves i had at the time some misgivings that the solitary man
who had made his bed on this wild spot must have been some poor
shipwrecked sailor who in trying to travel up the coast had here
laid himself down for his dreary night 

december th the weather continued very bad but it at last
permitted us to proceed with the survey the time hung heavy on our
hands as it always did when we were delayed from day to day by
successive gales of wind in the evening another harbour was
discovered where we anchored directly afterwards a man was seen
waving a shirt and a boat was sent which brought back two seamen a
party of six had run away from an american whaling vessel and had
landed a little to the southward in a boat which was shortly
afterwards knocked to pieces by the surf they had now been wandering
up and down the coast for fifteen months without knowing which way to
go or where they were what a singular piece of good fortune it was
that this harbour was now discovered had it not been for this one
chance they might have wandered till they had grown old men and at
last have perished on this wild coast their sufferings had been very
great and one of their party had lost his life by falling from the
cliffs they were sometimes obliged to separate in search of food and
this explained the bed of the solitary man considering what they had
undergone i think they had kept a very good reckoning of time for
they had lost only four days 

december th we anchored in a snug little cove at the foot of some
high hills near the northern extremity of tres montes after
breakfast the next morning a party ascended one of these mountains 
which was feet high the scenery was remarkable the chief part of
the range was composed of grand solid abrupt masses of granite which
appeared as if they had been coeval with the beginning of the world 
the granite was capped with mica-slate and this in the lapse of ages
had been worn into strange finger-shaped points these two formations 
thus differing in their outlines agree in being almost destitute of
vegetation this barrenness had to our eyes a strange appearance from
having been so long accustomed to the sight of an almost universal
forest of dark-green trees i took much delight in examining the
structure of these mountains the complicated and lofty ranges bore a
noble aspect of durability equally profitless however to man and to
all other animals granite to the geologist is classic ground from
its widespread limits and its beautiful and compact texture few rocks
have been more anciently recognised granite has given rise perhaps 
to more discussion concerning its origin than any other formation we
generally see it constituting the fundamental rock and however
formed we know it is the deepest layer in the crust of this globe to
which man has penetrated the limit of man s knowledge in any subject
possesses a high interest which is perhaps increased by its close
neighbourhood to the realms of imagination 

january st the new year is ushered in with the ceremonies
proper to it in these regions she lays out no false hopes a heavy
north-western gale with steady rain bespeaks the rising year thank
god we are not destined here to see the end of it but hope then to be
in the pacific ocean where a blue sky tells one there is a heaven a
something beyond the clouds above our heads 

the north-west winds prevailing for the next four days we only managed
to cross a great bay and then anchored in another secure harbour i
accompanied the captain in a boat to the head of a deep creek on the
way the number of seals which we saw was quite astonishing every bit
of flat rock and parts of the beach were covered with them there
appeared to be of a loving disposition and lay huddled together fast
asleep like so many pigs but even pigs would have been ashamed of
their dirt and of the foul smell which came from them each herd was
watched by the patient but inauspicious eyes of the turkey-buzzard 
this disgusting bird with its bald scarlet head formed to wallow in
putridity is very common on the west coast and their attendance on
the seals shows on what they rely for their food we found the water
 probably only that of the surface nearly fresh this was caused by
the number of torrents which in the form of cascades came tumbling
over the bold granite mountains into the sea the fresh water attracts
the fish and these bring many terns gulls and two kinds of
cormorant we saw also a pair of the beautiful black-necked swans and
several small sea-otters the fur of which is held in such high
estimation in returning we were again amused by the impetuous manner
in which the heap of seals old and young tumbled into the water as
the boat passed they did not remain long under water but rising 
followed us with outstretched necks expressing great wonder and
curiosity 

th having run up the coast we anchored near the northern end of the
chonos archipelago in low s harbour where we remained a week the
islands were here as in chiloe composed of a stratified soft 
littoral deposit and the vegetation in consequence was beautifully
luxuriant the woods came down to the sea-beach just in the manner of
an evergreen shrubbery over a gravel walk we also enjoyed from the
anchorage a splendid view of four great snowy cones of the cordillera 
including el famoso corcovado the range itself had in this latitude
so little height that few parts of it appeared above the tops of the
neighbouring islets we found here a party of five men from caylen 
 el fin del cristiandad who had most adventurously crossed in their
miserable boat-canoe for the purpose of fishing the open space of sea
which separates chonos from chiloe these islands will in all
probability in a short time become peopled like those adjoining the
coast of chiloe 


the wild potato grows on these islands in great abundance on the
sandy shelly soil near the sea-beach the tallest plant was four feet
in height the tubers were generally small but i found one of an
oval shape two inches in diameter they resembled in every respect 
and had the same smell as english potatoes but when boiled they shrunk
much and were watery and insipid without any bitter taste they are
undoubtedly here indigenous they grow as far south according to mr 
low as lat degs and are called aquinas by the wild indians of
that part the chilotan indians have a different name for them 
professor henslow who has examined the dried specimens which i brought
home says that they are the same with those described by mr sabine
 from valparaiso but that they form a variety which by some
botanists has been considered as specifically distinct it is
remarkable that the same plant should be found on the sterile mountains
of central chile where a drop of rain does not fall for more than six
months and within the damp forests of these southern islands 

in the central parts of the chonos archipelago lat degs the
forest has very much the same character with that along the whole west
coast for miles southward to cape horn the arborescent grass of
chiloe is not found here while the beech of tierra del fuego grows to
a good size and forms a considerable proportion of the wood not 
however in the same exclusive manner as it does farther southward 
cryptogamic plants here find a most congenial climate in the strait
of magellan as i have before remarked the country appears too cold
and wet to allow of their arriving at perfection but in these islands 
within the forest the number of species and great abundance of mosses 
lichens and small ferns is quite extraordinary in tierra del
fuego trees grow only on the hill-sides every level piece of land
being invariably covered by a thick bed of peat but in chiloe flat
land supports the most luxuriant forests here within the chonos
archipelago the nature of the climate more closely approaches that of
tierra del fuego than that of northern chiloe for every patch of level
ground is covered by two species of plants astelia pumila and donatia
magellanica which by their joint decay compose a thick bed of elastic
peat 

in tierra del fuego above the region of woodland the former of these
eminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the production of peat 
fresh leaves are always succeeding one to the other round the central
tap-root the lower ones soon decay and in tracing a root downwards in
the peat the leaves yet holding their place can be observed passing
through every stage of decomposition till the whole becomes blended in
one confused mass the astelia is assisted by a few other
plants here and there a small creeping myrtus m nummularia with a
woody stem like our cranberry and with a sweet berry an empetrum e 
rubrum like our heath a rush juncus grandiflorus are nearly the
only ones that grow on the swampy surface these plants though
possessing a very close general resemblance to the english species of
the same genera are different in the more level parts of the
country the surface of the peat is broken up into little pools of
water which stand at different heights and appear as if artificially
excavated small streams of water flowing underground complete the
disorganization of the vegetable matter and consolidate the whole 

the climate of the southern part of america appears particularly
favourable to the production of peat in the falkland islands almost
every kind of plant even the coarse grass which covers the whole
surface of the land becomes converted into this substance scarcely
any situation checks its growth some of the beds are as much as twelve
feet thick and the lower part becomes so solid when dry that it will
hardly burn although every plant lends its aid yet in most parts the
astelia is the most efficient it is rather a singular circumstance 
as being so very different from what occurs in europe that i nowhere
saw moss forming by its decay any portion of the peat in south america 
with respect to the northern limit at which the climate allows of that
peculiar kind of slow decomposition which is necessary for its
production i believe that in chiloe lat to degs although
there is much swampy ground no well-characterized peat occurs but in
the chonos islands three degrees farther southward we have seen that
it is abundant on the eastern coast in la plata lat degs i was
told by a spanish resident who had visited ireland that he had often
sought for this substance but had never been able to find any he
showed me as the nearest approach to it which he had discovered a
black peaty soil so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely
slow and imperfect combustion 


the zoology of these broken islets of the chonos archipelago is as
might have been expected very poor of quadrupeds two aquatic kinds
are common the myopotamus coypus like a beaver but with a round
tail is well known from its fine fur which is an object of trade
throughout the tributaries of la plata it here however exclusively
frequents salt water which same circumstance has been mentioned as
sometimes occurring with the great rodent the capybara a small
sea-otter is very numerous this animal does not feed exclusively on
fish but like the seals draws a large supply from a small red crab 
which swims in shoals near the surface of the water mr bynoe saw one
in tierra del fuego eating a cuttle-fish and at low s harbour another
was killed in the act of carrying to its hole a large volute shell at
one place i caught in a trap a singular little mouse m brachiotis 
it appeared common on several of the islets but the chilotans at low s
harbour said that it was not found in all what a succession of
chances or what changes of level must have been brought into play 
thus to spread these small animals throughout this broken archipelago 

in all parts of chiloe and chonos two very strange birds occur which
are allied to and replace the turco and tapacolo of central chile 
one is called by the inhabitants cheucau pteroptochos rubecula it
frequents the most gloomy and retired spots within the damp forests 
sometimes although its cry may be heard close at hand let a person
watch ever so attentively he will not see the cheucau at other times 
let him stand motionless and the red-breasted little bird will approach
within a few feet in the most familiar manner it then busily hops
about the entangled mass of rotting cones and branches with its little
tail cocked upwards the cheucau is held in superstitious fear by the
chilotans on account of its strange and varied cries there are three
very distinct cries one is called chiduco and is an omen of good 
another huitreu which is extremely unfavourable and a third which
i have forgotten these words are given in imitation of the noises 
and the natives are in some things absolutely governed by them the
chilotans assuredly have chosen a most comical little creature for
their prophet an allied species but rather larger is called by the
natives guid-guid pteroptochos tarnii and by the english the
barking-bird this latter name is well given for i defy any one at
first to feel certain that a small dog is not yelping somewhere in the
forest just as with the cheucau a person will sometimes hear the
bark close by but in vain many endeavour by watching and with still
less chance by beating the bushes to see the bird yet at other times
the guid-guid fearlessly comes near its manner of feeding and its
general habits are very similar to those of the cheucau 

on the coast a small dusky-coloured bird opetiorhynchus
patagonicus is very common it is remarkable from its quiet habits 
it lives entirely on the sea-beach like a sandpiper besides these
birds only few others inhabit this broken land in my rough notes i
describe the strange noises which although frequently heard within
these gloomy forests yet scarcely disturb the general silence the
yelping of the guid-guid and the sudden whew-whew of the cheucau 
sometimes come from afar off and sometimes from close at hand the
little black wren of tierra del fuego occasionally adds its cry the
creeper oxyurus follows the intruder screaming and twittering the
humming-bird may be seen every now and then darting from side to side 
and emitting like an insect its shrill chirp lastly from the top of
some lofty tree the indistinct but plaintive note of the white-tufted
tyrant-flycatcher myiobius may be noticed from the great
preponderance in most countries of certain common genera of birds such
as the finches one feels at first surprised at meeting with the
peculiar forms above enumerated as the commonest birds in any
district in central chile two of them namely the oxyurus and
scytalopus occur although most rarely when finding as in this
case animals which seem to play so insignificant a part in the great
scheme of nature one is apt to wonder why they were created 

but it should always be recollected that in some other country perhaps
they are essential members of society or at some former period may
have been so if america south of degs were sunk beneath the
waters of the ocean these two birds might continue to exist in central
chile for a long period but it is very improbable that their numbers
would increase we should then see a case which must inevitably have
happened with very many animals 

these southern seas are frequented by several species of petrels the
largest kind procellaria gigantea or nelly quebrantahuesos or
break-bones of the spaniards is a common bird both in the inland
channels and on the open sea in its habits and manner of flight there
is a very close resemblance with the albatross and as with the
albatross a person may watch it for hours together without seeing on
what it feeds the break-bones is however a rapacious bird for it
was observed by some of the officers at port st antonio chasing a
diver which tried to escape by diving and flying but was continually
struck down and at last killed by a blow on its head at port st 
julian these great petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls 
a second species puffinus cinereus which is common to europe cape
horn and the coast of peru is of much smaller size than the p 
gigantea but like it of a dirty black colour it generally
frequents the inland sounds in very large flocks i do not think i ever
saw so many birds of any other sort together as i once saw of these
behind the island of chiloe hundreds of thousands flew in an irregular
line for several hours in one direction when part of the flock
settled on the water the surface was blackened and a noise proceeded
from them as of human beings talking in the distance 

there are several other species of petrels but i will only mention one
other kind the pelacanoides berardi which offers an example of those
extraordinary cases of a bird evidently belonging to one well-marked
family yet both in its habits and structure allied to a very distinct
tribe this bird never leaves the quiet inland sounds when disturbed
it dives to a distance and on coming to the surface with the same
movement takes flight after flying by a rapid movement of its short
wings for a space in a straight line it drops as if struck dead and
dives again the form of its beak and nostrils length of foot and
even the colouring of its plumage show that this bird is a petrel on
the other hand its short wings and consequent little power of flight 
its form of body and shape of tail the absence of a hind toe to its
foot its habit of diving and its choice of situation make it at
first doubtful whether its relationship is not equally close with the
auks it would undoubtedly be mistaken for an auk when seen from a
distance either on the wing or when diving and quietly swimming about
the retired channels of tierra del fuego 

 horticultural transact vol v p mr caldeleugh sent home
two tubers which being well manured even the first season produced
numerous potatoes and an abundance of leaves see humboldt s
interesting discussion on this plant which it appears was unknown in
mexico in polit essay on new spain book iv chap ix 

 by sweeping with my insect-net i procured from these situations a
considerable number of minute insects of the family of staphylinidae 
and others allied to pselaphus and minute hymenoptera but the most
characteristic family in number both of individuals and species 
throughout the more open parts of chiloe and chonos is that of
telephoridae 

 it is said that some rapacious birds bring their prey alive to
their nests if so in the course of centuries every now and then 
one might escape from the young birds some such agency is necessary 
to account for the distribution of the smaller gnawing animals on
islands not very near each other 

 i may mention as a proof of how great a difference there is
between the seasons of the wooded and the open parts of this coast 
that on september th in lat degs these birds had young ones in
the nest while among the chonos islands three months later in the
summer they were only laying the difference in latitude between these
two places being about miles

chiloe and concepcion great earthquake

aconcagua and coseguina ride to cucao impenetrable forests valdivia
indians earthquake concepcion great earthquake rocks
fissured appearance of the former towns the sea black and
boiling direction of the vibrations stones twisted round great
wave permanent elevation of the land area of volcanic phenomena the
connection between the elevatory and eruptive forces cause of
earthquakes slow elevation of mountain-chains 


on january the th we sailed from low s harbour and three days
afterwards anchored a second time in the bay of s carlos in chiloe on
the night of the th the volcano of osorno was in action at midnight
the sentry observed something like a large star which gradually
increased in size till about three o clock when it presented a very
magnificent spectacle by the aid of a glass dark objects in
constant succession were seen in the midst of a great glare of red
light to be thrown up and to fall down the light was sufficient to
cast on the water a long bright reflection large masses of molten
matter seem very commonly to be cast out of the craters in this part of
the cordillera i was assured that when the corcovado is in eruption 
great masses are projected upwards and are seen to burst in the air 
assuming many fantastical forms such as trees their size must be
immense for they can be distinguished from the high land behind s 
carlos which is no less than ninety-three miles from the corcovado in
the morning the volcano became tranquil 

i was surprised at hearing afterwards that aconcagua in chile 
miles northwards was in action on the same night and still more
surprised to hear that the great eruption of coseguina miles
north of aconcagua accompanied by an earthquake felt over a 
miles also occurred within six hours of this same time this
coincidence is the more remarkable as coseguina had been dormant for
twenty-six years and aconcagua most rarely shows any signs of action 
it is difficult even to conjecture whether this coincidence was
accidental or shows some subterranean connection if vesuvius etna 
and hecla in iceland all three relatively nearer each other than the
corresponding points in south america suddenly burst forth in
eruption on the same night the coincidence would be thought
remarkable but it is far more remarkable in this case where the three
vents fall on the same great mountain-chain and where the vast plains
along the entire eastern coast and the upraised recent shells along
more than miles on the western coast show in how equable and
connected a manner the elevatory forces have acted 

captain fitz roy being anxious that some bearings should be taken on
the outer coast of chiloe it was planned that mr king and myself
should ride to castro and thence across the island to the capella de
cucao situated on the west coast having hired horses and a guide we
set out on the morning of the nd we had not proceeded far before
we were joined by a woman and two boys who were bent on the same
journey every one on this road acts on a hail fellow well met 
fashion and one may here enjoy the privilege so rare in south
america of travelling without fire-arms at first the country
consisted of a succession of hills and valleys nearer to castro it
became very level the road itself is a curious affair it consists in
its whole length with the exception of very few parts of great logs
of wood which are either broad and laid longitudinally or narrow and
placed transversely in summer the road is not very bad but in
winter when the wood is rendered slippery from rain travelling is
exceedingly difficult at that time of the year the ground on each
side becomes a morass and is often overflowed hence it is necessary
that the longitudinal logs should be fastened down by transverse poles 
which are pegged on each side into the earth these pegs render a fall
from a horse dangerous as the chance of alighting on one of them is
not small it is remarkable however how active custom has made the
chilotan horses in crossing bad parts where the logs had been
displaced they skipped from one to the other almost with the
quickness and certainty of a dog on both hands the road is bordered
by the lofty forest-trees with their bases matted together by canes 
when occasionally a long reach of this avenue could be beheld it
presented a curious scene of uniformity the white line of logs 
narrowing in perspective became hidden by the gloomy forest or
terminated in a zigzag which ascended some steep hill 

although the distance from s carlos to castro is only twelve leagues
in a straight line the formation of the road must have been a great
labour i was told that several people had formerly lost their lives
in attempting to cross the forest the first who succeeded was an
indian who cut his way through the canes in eight days and reached s 
carlos he was rewarded by the spanish government with a grant of land 
during the summer many of the indians wander about the forests but
chiefly in the higher parts where the woods are not quite so thick in
search of the half-wild cattle which live on the leaves of the cane and
certain trees it was one of these huntsmen who by chance discovered 
a few years since an english vessel which had been wrecked on the
outer coast the crew were beginning to fail in provisions and it is
not probable that without the aid of this man they would ever have
extricated themselves from these scarcely penetrable woods as it was 
one seaman died on the march from fatigue the indians in these
excursions steer by the sun so that if there is a continuance of
cloudy weather they can not travel 

the day was beautiful and the number of trees which were in full
flower perfumed the air yet even this could hardly dissipate the
effects of the gloomy dampness of the forest moreover the many dead
trunks that stand like skeletons never fail to give to these primeval
woods a character of solemnity absent in those of countries long
civilized shortly after sunset we bivouacked for the night our
female companion who was rather good-looking belonged to one of the
most respectable families in castro she rode however astride and
without shoes or stockings i was surprised at the total want of pride
shown by her and her brother they brought food with them but at all
our meals sat watching mr king and myself whilst eating till we were
fairly shamed into feeding the whole party the night was cloudless 
and while lying in our beds we enjoyed the sight and it is a high
enjoyment of the multitude of stars which illumined the darkness of
the forest 

january rd we rose early in the morning and reached the pretty
quiet town of castro by two o clock the old governor had died since
our last visit and a chileno was acting in his place we had a letter
of introduction to don pedro whom we found exceedingly hospitable and
kind and more disinterested than is usual on this side of the
continent the next day don pedro procured us fresh horses and
offered to accompany us himself we proceeded to the south generally
following the coast and passing through several hamlets each with its
large barn-like chapel built of wood at vilipilli don pedro asked
the commandant to give us a guide to cucao the old gentleman offered
to come himself but for a long time nothing would persuade him that
two englishmen really wished to go to such an out-of-the-way place as
cucao we were thus accompanied by the two greatest aristocrats in the
country as was plainly to be seen in the manner of all the poorer
indians towards them at chonchi we struck across the island 
following intricate winding paths sometimes passing through
magnificent forests and sometimes through pretty cleared spots 
abounding with corn and potato crops this undulating woody country 
partially cultivated reminded me of the wilder parts of england and
therefore had to my eye a most fascinating aspect at vilinco which
is situated on the borders of the lake of cucao only a few fields were
cleared and all the inhabitants appeared to be indians this lake is
twelve miles long and runs in an east and west direction from local
circumstances the sea-breeze blows very regularly during the day and
during the night it falls calm this has given rise to strange
exaggerations for the phenomenon as described to us at s carlos was
quite a prodigy 

the road to cucao was so very bad that we determined to embark in a
 periagua the commandant in the most authoritative manner ordered
six indians to get ready to pull us over without deigning to tell them
whether they would be paid the periagua is a strange rough boat but
the crew were still stranger i doubt if six uglier little men ever got
into a boat together they pulled however very well and cheerfully 
the stroke-oarsman gabbled indian and uttered strange cries much
after the fashion of a pig-driver driving his pigs we started with a
light breeze against us but yet reached the capella de cucao before it
was late the country on each side of the lake was one unbroken
forest in the same periagua with us a cow was embarked to get so
large an animal into a small boat appears at first a difficulty but
the indians managed it in a minute they brought the cow alongside the
boat which was heeled towards her then placing two oars under her
belly with their ends resting on the gunwale by the aid of these
levers they fairly tumbled the poor beast heels over head into the
bottom of the boat and then lashed her down with ropes at cucao we
found an uninhabited hovel which is the residence of the padre when he
pays this capella a visit where lighting a fire we cooked our
supper and were very comfortable 

the district of cucao is the only inhabited part on the whole west
coast of chiloe it contains about thirty or forty indian families 
who are scattered along four or five miles of the shore they are very
much secluded from the rest of chiloe and have scarcely any sort of
commerce except sometimes in a little oil which they get from
seal-blubber they are tolerably dressed in clothes of their own
manufacture and they have plenty to eat they seemed however 
discontented yet humble to a degree which it was quite painful to
witness these feelings are i think chiefly to be attributed to the
harsh and authoritative manner in which they are treated by their
rulers our companions although so very civil to us behaved to the
poor indians as if they had been slaves rather than free men they
ordered provisions and the use of their horses without ever
condescending to say how much or indeed whether the owners should be
paid at all in the morning being left alone with these poor people 
we soon ingratiated ourselves by presents of cigars and mate a lump
of white sugar was divided between all present and tasted with the
greatest curiosity the indians ended all their complaints by saying 
 and it is only because we are poor indians and know nothing but it
was not so when we had a king 

the next day after breakfast we rode a few miles northward to punta
huantamo the road lay along a very broad beach on which even after
so many fine days a terrible surf was breaking i was assured that
after a heavy gale the roar can be heard at night even at castro a
distance of no less than twenty-one sea-miles across a hilly and wooded
country we had some difficulty in reaching the point owing to the
intolerably bad paths for everywhere in the shade the ground soon
becomes a perfect quagmire the point itself is a bold rocky hill it
is covered by a plant allied i believe to bromelia and called by the
inhabitants chepones in scrambling through the beds our hands were
very much scratched i was amused by observing the precaution our
indian guide took in turning up his trousers thinking that they were
more delicate than his own hard skin this plant bears a fruit in
shape like an artichoke in which a number of seed-vessels are packed 
these contain a pleasant sweet pulp here much esteemed i saw at
low s harbour the chilotans making chichi or cider with this fruit 
so true is it as humboldt remarks that almost everywhere man finds
means of preparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom 
the savages however of tierra del fuego and i believe of australia 
have not advanced thus far in the arts 

the coast to the north of punta huantamo is exceedingly rugged and
broken and is fronted by many breakers on which the sea is eternally
roaring mr king and myself were anxious to return if it had been
possible on foot along this coast but even the indians said it was
quite impracticable we were told that men have crossed by striking
directly through the woods from cucao to s carlos but never by the
coast on these expeditions the indians carry with them only roasted
corn and of this they eat sparingly twice a day 

th re-embarking in the periagua we returned across the lake and
then mounted our horses the whole of chiloe took advantage of this
week of unusually fine weather to clear the ground by burning in
every direction volumes of smoke were curling upwards although the
inhabitants were so assiduous in setting fire to every part of the
wood yet i did not see a single fire which they had succeeded in
making extensive we dined with our friend the commandant and did not
reach castro till after dark the next morning we started very early 
after having ridden for some time we obtained from the brow of a steep
hill an extensive view and it is a rare thing on this road of the
great forest over the horizon of trees the volcano of corcovado and
the great flat-topped one to the north stood out in proud
pre-eminence scarcely another peak in the long range showed its snowy
summit i hope it will be long before i forget this farewell view of
the magnificent cordillera fronting chiloe at night we bivouacked
under a cloudless sky and the next morning reached s carlos we
arrived on the right day for before evening heavy rain commenced 

february th sailed from chiloe during the last week i made several
short excursions one was to examine a great bed of now-existing
shells elevated feet above the level of the sea from among these
shells large forest-trees were growing another ride was to p 
huechucucuy i had with me a guide who knew the country far too well 
for he would pertinaciously tell me endless indian names for every
little point rivulet and creek in the same manner as in tierra del
fuego the indian language appears singularly well adapted for
attaching names to the most trivial features of the land i believe
every one was glad to say farewell to chiloe yet if we could forget
the gloom and ceaseless rain of winter chiloe might pass for a
charming island there is also something very attractive in the
simplicity and humble politeness of the poor inhabitants 

we steered northward along shore but owing to thick weather did not
reach valdivia till the night of the th the next morning the boat
proceeded to the town which is distant about ten miles we followed
the course of the river occasionally passing a few hovels and patches
of ground cleared out of the otherwise unbroken forest and sometimes
meeting a canoe with an indian family the town is situated on the low
banks of the stream and is so completely buried in a wood of
apple-trees that the streets are merely paths in an orchard i have
never seen any country where apple-trees appeared to thrive so well as
in this damp part of south america on the borders of the roads there
were many young trees evidently self-grown in chiloe the inhabitants
possess a marvellously short method of making an orchard at the lower
part of almost every branch small conical brown wrinkled points
project these are always ready to change into roots as may sometimes
be seen where any mud has been accidentally splashed against the tree 
a branch as thick as a man s thigh is chosen in the early spring and
is cut off just beneath a group of these points all the smaller
branches are lopped off and it is then placed about two feet deep in
the ground during the ensuing summer the stump throws out long
shoots and sometimes even bears fruit i was shown one which had
produced as many as twenty-three apples but this was thought very
unusual in the third season the stump is changed as i have myself
seen into a well-wooded tree loaded with fruit an old man near
valdivia illustrated his motto necesidad es la madre del invencion 
by giving an account of the several useful things he manufactured from
his apples after making cider and likewise wine he extracted from
the refuse a white and finely flavoured spirit by another process he
procured a sweet treacle or as he called it honey his children and
pigs seemed almost to live during this season of the year in his
orchard 

february th i set out with a guide on a short ride in which 
however i managed to see singularly little either of the geology of
the country or of its inhabitants there is not much cleared land near
valdivia after crossing a river at the distance of a few miles we
entered the forest and then passed only one miserable hovel before
reaching our sleeping-place for the night the short difference in
latitude of miles has given a new aspect to the forest compared
with that of chiloe this is owing to a slightly different proportion
in the kinds of trees the evergreens do not appear to be quite so
numerous and the forest in consequence has a brighter tint as in
chiloe the lower parts are matted together by canes here also another
kind resembling the bamboo of brazil and about twenty feet in height 
grows in clusters and ornaments the banks of some of the streams in a
very pretty manner it is with this plant that the indians make their
chuzos or long tapering spears our resting-house was so dirty that i
preferred sleeping outside on these journeys the first night is
generally very uncomfortable because one is not accustomed to the
tickling and biting of the fleas i am sure in the morning there was
not a space on my legs the size of a shilling which had not its little
red mark where the flea had feasted 

th we continued to ride through the uncleared forest only
occasionally meeting an indian on horseback or a troop of fine mules
bringing alerce-planks and corn from the southern plains in the
afternoon one of the horses knocked up we were then on a brow of a
hill which commanded a fine view of the llanos the view of these
open plains was very refreshing after being hemmed in and buried in
the wilderness of trees the uniformity of a forest soon becomes very
wearisome this west coast makes me remember with pleasure the free 
unbounded plains of patagonia yet with the true spirit of
contradiction i cannot forget how sublime is the silence of the
forest the llanos are the most fertile and thickly peopled parts of
the country as they possess the immense advantage of being nearly free
from trees before leaving the forest we crossed some flat little
lawns around which single trees stood as in an english park i have
often noticed with surprise in wooded undulatory districts that the
quite level parts have been destitute of trees on account of the
tired horse i determined to stop at the mission of cudico to the
friar of which i had a letter of introduction cudico is an
intermediate district between the forest and the llanos there are a
good many cottages with patches of corn and potatoes nearly all
belonging to indians the tribes dependent on valdivia are reducidos y
cristianos the indians farther northward about arauco and imperial 
are still very wild and not converted but they have all much
intercourse with the spaniards the padre said that the christian
indians did not much like coming to mass but that otherwise they
showed respect for religion the greatest difficulty is in making them
observe the ceremonies of marriage the wild indians take as many
wives as they can support and a cacique will sometimes have more than
ten on entering his house the number may be told by that of the
separate fires each wife lives a week in turn with the cacique but
all are employed in weaving ponchos etc for his profit to be the
wife of a cacique is an honour much sought after by the indian women 

the men of all these tribes wear a coarse woolen poncho those south of
valdivia wear short trousers and those north of it a petticoat like
the chilipa of the gauchos all have their long hair bound by a
scarlet fillet but with no other covering on their heads these
indians are good-sized men their cheek-bones are prominent and in
general appearance they resemble the great american family to which
they belong but their physiognomy seemed to me to be slightly
different from that of any other tribe which i had before seen their
expression is generally grave and even austere and possesses much
character this may pass either for honest bluntness or fierce
determination the long black hair the grave and much-lined features 
and the dark complexion called to my mind old portraits of james i on
the road we met with none of that humble politeness so universal in
chiloe some gave their mari-mari good morning with promptness 
but the greater number did not seem inclined to offer any salute this
independence of manners is probably a consequence of their long wars 
and the repeated victories which they alone of all the tribes in
america have gained over the spaniards 

i spent the evening very pleasantly talking with the padre he was
exceedingly kind and hospitable and coming from santiago had
contrived to surround himself with some few comforts being a man of
some little education he bitterly complained of the total want of
society with no particular zeal for religion no business or pursuit 
how completely must this man s life be wasted the next day on our
return we met seven very wild-looking indians of whom some were
caciques that had just received from the chilian government their
yearly small stipend for having long remained faithful they were
fine-looking men and they rode one after the other with most gloomy
faces an old cacique who headed them had been i suppose more
excessively drunk than the rest for he seemed extremely grave and very
crabbed shortly before this two indians joined us who were
travelling from a distant mission to valdivia concerning some lawsuit 
one was a good-humoured old man but from his wrinkled beardless face
looked more like an old woman than a man i frequently presented both
of them with cigars and though ready to receive them and i dare say
grateful they would hardly condescend to thank me a chilotan indian
would have taken off his hat and given his dios le page the
travelling was very tedious both from the badness of the roads and
from the number of great fallen trees which it was necessary either to
leap over or to avoid by making long circuits we slept on the road 
and next morning reached valdivia whence i proceeded on board 

a few days afterwards i crossed the bay with a party of officers and
landed near the fort called niebla the buildings were in a most
ruinous state and the gun-carriages quite rotten mr wickham
remarked to the commanding officer that with one discharge they would
certainly all fall to pieces the poor man trying to put a good face
upon it gravely replied no i am sure sir they would stand two 
the spaniards must have intended to have made this place impregnable 
there is now lying in the middle of the courtyard a little mountain of
mortar which rivals in hardness the rock on which it is placed it
was brought from chile and cost dollars the revolution having
broken out prevented its being applied to any purpose and now it
remains a monument of the fallen greatness of spain 

i wanted to go to a house about a mile and a half distant but my guide
said it was quite impossible to penetrate the wood in a straight line 
he offered however to lead me by following obscure cattle-tracks 
the shortest way the walk nevertheless took no less than three
hours this man is employed in hunting strayed cattle yet well as he
must know the woods he was not long since lost for two whole days and
had nothing to eat these facts convey a good idea of the
impracticability of the forests of these countries a question often
occurred to me how long does any vestige of a fallen tree remain this
man showed me one which a party of fugitive royalists had cut down
fourteen years ago and taking this as a criterion i should think a
bole a foot and a half in diameter would in thirty years be changed
into a heap of mould 

february th this day has been memorable in the annals of valdivia 
for the most severe earthquake experienced by the oldest inhabitant i
happened to be on shore and was lying down in the wood to rest myself 
it came on suddenly and lasted two minutes but the time appeared much
longer the rocking of the ground was very sensible the undulations
appeared to my companion and myself to come from due east whilst
others thought they proceeded from south-west this shows how difficult
it sometimes is to perceive the directions of the vibrations there
was no difficulty in standing upright but the motion made me almost
giddy it was something like the movement of a vessel in a little
cross-ripple or still more like that felt by a person skating over
thin ice which bends under the weight of his body a bad earthquake at
once destroys our oldest associations the earth the very emblem of
solidity has moved beneath our feet like a thin crust over a
fluid one second of time has created in the mind a strange idea of
insecurity which hours of reflection would not have produced in the
forest as a breeze moved the trees i felt only the earth tremble but
saw no other effect captain fitz roy and some officers were at the
town during the shock and there the scene was more striking for
although the houses from being built of wood did not fall they were
violently shaken and the boards creaked and rattled together the
people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm it is these
accompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes 
experienced by all who have thus seen as well as felt their effects 
within the forest it was a deeply interesting but by no means an
awe-exciting phenomenon the tides were very curiously affected the
great shock took place at the time of low water and an old woman who
was on the beach told me that the water flowed very quickly but not in
great waves to high-water mark and then as quickly returned to its
proper level this was also evident by the line of wet sand the same
kind of quick but quiet movement in the tide happened a few years since
at chiloe during a slight earthquake and created much causeless
alarm in the course of the evening there were many weaker shocks 
which seemed to produce in the harbour the most complicated currents 
and some of great strength 


march th we entered the harbour of concepcion while the ship was
beating up to the anchorage i landed on the island of quiriquina the
mayor-domo of the estate quickly rode down to tell me the terrible news
of the great earthquake of the th that not a house in concepcion
or talcahuano the port was standing that seventy villages were
destroyed and that a great wave had almost washed away the ruins of
talcahuano of this latter statement i soon saw abundant proofs the
whole coast being strewed over with timber and furniture as if a
thousand ships had been wrecked besides chairs tables book-shelves 
etc in great numbers there were several roofs of cottages which had
been transported almost whole the storehouses at talcahuano had been
burst open and great bags of cotton yerba and other valuable
merchandise were scattered on the shore during my walk round the
island i observed that numerous fragments of rock which from the
marine productions adhering to them must recently have been lying in
deep water had been cast up high on the beach one of these was six
feet long three broad and two thick 

the island itself as plainly showed the overwhelming power of the
earthquake as the beach did that of the consequent great wave the
ground in many parts was fissured in north and south lines perhaps
caused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of this narrow
island some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide many
enormous masses had already fallen on the beach and the inhabitants
thought that when the rains commenced far greater slips would happen 
the effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate which composes
the foundation of the island was still more curious the superficial
parts of some narrow ridges were as completely shivered as if they had
been blasted by gunpowder this effect which was rendered conspicuous
by the fresh fractures and displaced soil must be confined to near the
surface for otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock
throughout chile nor is this improbable as it is known that the
surface of a vibrating body is affected differently from the central
part it is perhaps owing to this same reason that earthquakes do
not cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would be
expected i believe this convulsion has been more effectual in
lessening the size of the island of quiriquina than the ordinary
wear-and-tear of the sea and weather during the course of a whole
century 

the next day i landed at talcahuano and afterwards rode to concepcion 
both towns presented the most awful yet interesting spectacle i ever
beheld to a person who had formerly know them it possibly might have
been still more impressive for the ruins were so mingled together and
the whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place that
it was scarcely possible to imagine its former condition the
earthquake commenced at half-past eleven o clock in the forenoon if
it had happened in the middle of the night the greater number of the
inhabitants which in this one province must amount to many thousands 
must have perished instead of less than a hundred as it was the
invariable practice of running out of doors at the first trembling of
the ground alone saved them in concepcion each house or row of
houses stood by itself a heap or line of ruins but in talcahuano 
owing to the great wave little more than one layer of bricks tiles 
and timber with here and there part of a wall left standing could be
distinguished from this circumstance concepcion although not so
completely desolated was a more terrible and if i may so call it 
picturesque sight the first shock was very sudden the mayor-domo at
quiriquina told me that the first notice he received of it was
finding both the horse he rode and himself rolling together on the
ground rising up he was again thrown down he also told me that
some cows which were standing on the steep side of the island were
rolled into the sea the great wave caused the destruction of many
cattle on one low island near the head of the bay seventy animals
were washed off and drowned it is generally thought that this has
been the worst earthquake ever recorded in chile but as the very
severe ones occur only after long intervals this cannot easily be
known nor indeed would a much worse shock have made any difference 
for the ruin was now complete innumerable small tremblings followed
the great earthquake and within the first twelve days no less than
three hundred were counted 

after viewing concepcion i cannot understand how the greater number of
inhabitants escaped unhurt the houses in many parts fell outwards 
thus forming in the middle of the streets little hillocks of brickwork
and rubbish mr rouse the english consul told us that he was at
breakfast when the first movement warned him to run out he had
scarcely reached the middle of the courtyard when one side of his
house came thundering down he retained presence of mind to remember 
that if he once got on the top of that part which had already fallen 
he would be safe not being able from the motion of the ground to
stand he crawled up on his hands and knees and no sooner had he
ascended this little eminence than the other side of the house fell
in the great beams sweeping close in front of his head with his eyes
blinded and his mouth choked with the cloud of dust which darkened the
sky at last he gained the street as shock succeeded shock at the
interval of a few minutes no one dared approach the shattered ruins 
and no one knew whether his dearest friends and relations were not
perishing from the want of help those who had saved any property were
obliged to keep a constant watch for thieves prowled about and at
each little trembling of the ground with one hand they beat their
breasts and cried misericordia and then with the other filched what
they could from the ruins the thatched roofs fell over the fires and
flames burst forth in all parts hundreds knew themselves ruined and
few had the means of providing food for the day 

earthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the prosperity of any
country if beneath england the now inert subterranean forces should
exert those powers which most assuredly in former geological ages they
have exerted how completely would the entire condition of the country
be changed what would become of the lofty houses thickly packed
cities great manufactories the beautiful public and private edifices 
if the new period of disturbance were first to commence by some great
earthquake in the dead of the night how terrific would be the carnage 
england would at once be bankrupt all papers records and accounts
would from that moment be lost government being unable to collect the
taxes and failing to maintain its authority the hand of violence and
rapine would remain uncontrolled in every large town famine would go
forth pestilence and death following in its train 

shortly after the shock a great wave was seen from the distance of
three or four miles approaching in the middle of the bay with a smooth
outline but along the shore it tore up cottages and trees as it swept
onwards with irresistible force at the head of the bay it broke in a
fearful line of white breakers which rushed up to a height of 
vertical feet above the highest spring-tides their force must have
been prodigious for at the fort a cannon with its carriage estimated
at four tons in weight was moved feet inwards a schooner was left
in the midst of the ruins yards from the beach the first wave
was followed by two others which in their retreat carried away a vast
wreck of floating objects in one part of the bay a ship was pitched
high and dry on shore was carried off again driven on shore and
again carried off in another part two large vessels anchored near
together were whirled about and their cables were thrice wound round
each other though anchored at a depth of feet they were for some
minutes aground the great wave must have travelled slowly for the
inhabitants of talcahuano had time to run up the hills behind the town 
and some sailors pulled out seaward trusting successfully to their
boat riding securely over the swell if they could reach it before it
broke one old woman with a little boy four or five years old ran
into a boat but there was nobody to row it out the boat was
consequently dashed against an anchor and cut in twain the old woman
was drowned but the child was picked up some hours afterwards clinging
to the wreck pools of salt-water were still standing amidst the ruins
of the houses and children making boats with old tables and chairs 
appeared as happy as their parents were miserable it was however 
exceedingly interesting to observe how much more active and cheerful
all appeared than could have been expected it was remarked with much
truth that from the destruction being universal no one individual was
humbled more than another or could suspect his friends of
coldness that most grievous result of the loss of wealth mr rouse 
and a large party whom he kindly took under his protection lived for
the first week in a garden beneath some apple-trees at first they were
as merry as if it had been a picnic but soon afterwards heavy rain
caused much discomfort for they were absolutely without shelter 

in captain fitz roy s excellent account of the earthquake it is said
that two explosions one like a column of smoke and another like the
blowing of a great whale were seen in the bay the water also
appeared everywhere to be boiling and it became black and exhaled a
most disagreeable sulphureous smell these latter circumstances were
observed in the bay of valparaiso during the earthquake of they
may i think be accounted for by the disturbance of the mud at the
bottom of the sea containing organic matter in decay in the bay of
callao during a calm day i noticed that as the ship dragged her
cable over the bottom its course was marked by a line of bubbles the
lower orders in talcahuano thought that the earthquake was caused by
some old indian women who two years ago being offended stopped the
volcano of antuco this silly belief is curious because it shows that
experience has taught them to observe that there exists a relation
between the suppressed action of the volcanos and the trembling of the
ground it was necessary to apply the witchcraft to the point where
their perception of cause and effect failed and this was the closing
of the volcanic vent this belief is the more singular in this
particular instance because according to captain fitz roy there is
reason to believe that antuco was noways affected 

the town of concepcion was built in the usual spanish fashion with all
the streets running at right angles to each other one set ranging s w 
by w and the other set n w by n the walls in the former direction
certainly stood better than those in the latter the greater number of
the masses of brickwork were thrown down towards the n e both these
circumstances perfectly agree with the general idea of the undulations
having come from the s w in which quarter subterranean noises were
also heard for it is evident that the walls running s w and n e 
which presented their ends to the point whence the undulations came 
would be much less likely to fall than those walls which running n w 
and s e must in their whole lengths have been at the same instant
thrown out of the perpendicular for the undulations coming from the
s w must have extended in n w and s e waves as they passed under
the foundations this may be illustrated by placing books edgeways on
a carpet and then after the manner suggested by michell imitating
the undulations of an earthquake it will be found that they fall with
more or less readiness according as their direction more or less
nearly coincides with the line of the waves the fissures in the
ground generally though not uniformly extended in a s e and n w 
direction and therefore corresponded to the lines of undulation or of
principal flexure bearing in mind all these circumstances which so
clearly point to the s w as the chief focus of disturbance it is a
very interesting fact that the island of s maria situated in that
quarter was during the general uplifting of the land raised to
nearly three times the height of any other part of the coast 

the different resistance offered by the walls according to their
direction was well exemplified in the case of the cathedral the side
which fronted the n e presented a grand pile of ruins in the midst of
which door-cases and masses of timber stood up as if floating in a
stream some of the angular blocks of brickwork were of great
dimensions and they were rolled to a distance on the level plaza like
fragments of rock at the base of some high mountain the side walls
 running s w and n e though exceedingly fractured yet remained
standing but the vast buttresses at right angles to them and
therefore parallel to the walls that fell were in many cases cut clean
off as if by a chisel and hurled to the ground some square
ornaments on the coping of these same walls were moved by the
earthquake into a diagonal position a similar circumstance was
observed after an earthquake at valparaiso calabria and other places 
including some of the ancient greek temples this twisting
displacement at first appears to indicate a vorticose movement beneath
each point thus affected but this is highly improbable may it not be
caused by a tendency in each stone to arrange itself in some particular
position with respect to the lines of vibration in a manner somewhat
similar to pins on a sheet of paper when shaken generally speaking 
arched doorways or windows stood much better than any other part of the
buildings nevertheless a poor lame old man who had been in the
habit during trifling shocks of crawling to a certain doorway was
this time crushed to pieces 

i have not attempted to give any detailed description of the appearance
of concepcion for i feel that it is quite impossible to convey the
mingled feelings which i experienced several of the officers visited
it before me but their strongest language failed to give a just idea
of the scene of desolation it is a bitter and humiliating thing to
see works which have cost man so much time and labour overthrown in
one minute yet compassion for the inhabitants was almost instantly
banished by the surprise in seeing a state of things produced in a
moment of time which one was accustomed to attribute to a succession
of ages in my opinion we have scarcely beheld since leaving
england any sight so deeply interesting 

in almost every severe earthquake the neighbouring waters of the sea
are said to have been greatly agitated the disturbance seems
generally as in the case of concepcion to have been of two kinds 
first at the instant of the shock the water swells high up on the
beach with a gentle motion and then as quietly retreats secondly 
some time afterwards the whole body of the sea retires from the coast 
and then returns in waves of overwhelming force the first movement
seems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake affecting
differently a fluid and a solid so that their respective levels are
slightly deranged but the second case is a far more important
phenomenon during most earthquakes and especially during those on
the west coast of america it is certain that the first great movement
of the waters has been a retirement some authors have attempted to
explain this by supposing that the water retains its level whilst the
land oscillates upwards but surely the water close to the land even
on a rather steep coast would partake of the motion of the bottom 
moreover as urged by mr lyell similar movements of the sea have
occurred at islands far distant from the chief line of disturbance as
was the case with juan fernandez during this earthquake and with
madeira during the famous lisbon shock i suspect but the subject is
a very obscure one that a wave however produced first draws the
water from the shore on which it is advancing to break i have
observed that this happens with the little waves from the paddles of a
steam-boat it is remarkable that whilst talcahuano and callao near
lima both situated at the head of large shallow bays have suffered
during every severe earthquake from great waves valparaiso seated
close to the edge of profoundly deep water has never been overwhelmed 
though so often shaken by the severest shocks from the great wave not
immediately following the earthquake but sometimes after the interval
of even half an hour and from distant islands being affected similarly
with the coasts near the focus of the disturbance it appears that the
wave first rises in the offing and as this is of general occurrence 
the cause must be general i suspect we must look to the line where
the less disturbed waters of the deep ocean join the water nearer the
coast which has partaken of the movements of the land as the place
where the great wave is first generated it would also appear that the
wave is larger or smaller according to the extent of shoal water which
has been agitated together with the bottom on which it rested 


the most remarkable effect of this earthquake was the permanent
elevation of the land it would probably be far more correct to speak
of it as the cause there can be no doubt that the land round the bay
of concepcion was upraised two or three feet but it deserves notice 
that owing to the wave having obliterated the old lines of tidal action
on the sloping sandy shores i could discover no evidence of this fact 
except in the united testimony of the inhabitants that one little
rocky shoal now exposed was formerly covered with water at the
island of s maria about thirty miles distant the elevation was
greater on one part captain fitz roy founds beds of putrid
mussel-shells still adhering to the rocks ten feet above high-water
mark the inhabitants had formerly dived at lower-water spring-tides
for these shells the elevation of this province is particularly
interesting from its having been the theatre of several other violent
earthquakes and from the vast numbers of sea-shells scattered over the
land up to a height of certainly and i believe of feet at
valparaiso as i have remarked similar shells are found at the height
of feet it is hardly possible to doubt that this great elevation
has been effected by successive small uprisings such as that which
accompanied or caused the earthquake of this year and likewise by an
insensibly slow rise which is certainly in progress on some parts of
this coast 

the island of juan fernandez miles to the n e was at the time
of the great shock of the th violently shaken so that the trees
beat against each other and a volcano burst forth under water close to
the shore these facts are remarkable because this island during the
earthquake of was then also affected more violently than other
places at an equal distance from concepcion and this seems to show
some subterranean connection between these two points chiloe about
 miles southward of concepcion appears to have been shaken more
strongly than the intermediate district of valdivia where the volcano
of villarica was noways affected whilst in the cordillera in front of
chiloe two of the volcanos burst-forth at the same instant in violent
action these two volcanos and some neighbouring ones continued for
a long time in eruption and ten months afterwards were again
influenced by an earthquake at concepcion some men cutting wood near
the base of one of these volcanos did not perceive the shock of the
th although the whole surrounding province was then trembling here
we have an eruption relieving and taking the place of an earthquake as
would have happened at concepcion according to the belief of the lower
orders if the volcano at antuco had not been closed by witchcraft two
years and three-quarters afterwards valdivia and chiloe were again
shaken more violently than on the th and an island in the chonos
archipelago was permanently elevated more than eight feet it will give
a better idea of the scale of these phenomena if as in the case of
the glaciers we suppose them to have taken place at corresponding
distances in europe then would the land from the north sea to the
mediterranean have been violently shaken and at the same instant of
time a large tract of the eastern coast of england would have been
permanently elevated together with some outlying islands a train of
volcanos on the coast of holland would have burst forth in action and
an eruption taken place at the bottom of the sea near the northern
extremity of ireland and lastly the ancient vents of auvergne 
cantal and mont d or would each have sent up to the sky a dark column
of smoke and have long remained in fierce action two years and
three-quarters afterwards france from its centre to the english
channel would have been again desolated by an earthquake and an island
permanently upraised in the mediterranean 

the space from under which volcanic matter on the th was actually
erupted is miles in one line and miles in another line at
right angles to the first hence in all probability a subterranean
lake of lava is here stretched out of nearly double the area of the
black sea from the intimate and complicated manner in which the
elevatory and eruptive forces were shown to be connected during this
train of phenomena we may confidently come to the conclusion that the
forces which slowly and by little starts uplift continents and those
which at successive periods pour forth volcanic matter from open
orifices are identical from many reasons i believe that the
frequent quakings of the earth on this line of coast are caused by the
rending of the strata necessarily consequent on the tension of the
land when upraised and their injection by fluidified rock this
rending and injection would if repeated often enough and we know that
earthquakes repeatedly affect the same areas in the same manner form
a chain of hills and the linear island of s mary which was upraised
thrice the height of the neighbouring country seems to be undergoing
this process i believe that the solid axis of a mountain differs in
its manner of formation from a volcanic hill only in the molten stone
having been repeatedly injected instead of having been repeatedly
ejected moreover i believe that it is impossible to explain the
structure of great mountain-chains such as that of the cordillera 
were the strata capping the injected axis of plutonic rock have been
thrown on their edges along several parallel and neighbouring lines of
elevation except on this view of the rock of the axis having been
repeatedly injected after intervals sufficiently long to allow the
upper parts or wedges to cool and become solid for if the strata had
been thrown into their present highly inclined vertical and even
inverted positions by a single blow the very bowels of the earth
would have gushed out and instead of beholding abrupt mountain-axes of
rock solidified under great pressure deluges of lava would have flowed
out at innumerable points on every line of elevation

march th we stayed three days at concepcion and then sailed
for valparaiso the wind being northerly we only reached the mouth of
the harbour of concepcion before it was dark being very near the
land and a fog coming on the anchor was dropped presently a large
american whaler appeared alongside of us and we heard the yankee
swearing at his men to keep quiet whilst he listened for the breakers 
captain fitz roy hailed him in a loud clear voice to anchor where he
then was the poor man must have thought the voice came from the
shore such a babel of cries issued at once from the ship every one
hallooing out let go the anchor veer cable shorten sail it was
the most laughable thing i ever heard if the ship s crew had been all
captains and no men there could not have been a greater uproar of
orders we afterwards found that the mate stuttered i suppose all
hands were assisting him in giving his orders 

on the th we anchored at valparaiso and two days afterwards i set
out to cross the cordillera i proceeded to santiago where mr 
caldcleugh most kindly assisted me in every possible way in making the
little preparations which were necessary in this part of chile there
are two passes across the andes to mendoza the one most commonly used 
namely that of aconcagua or uspallata is situated some way to the
north the other called the portillo is to the south and nearer but
more lofty and dangerous 

march th we set out for the portillo pass leaving santiago we
crossed the wide burnt-up plain on which that city stands and in the
afternoon arrived at the maypu one of the principal rivers in chile 
the valley at the point where it enters the first cordillera is
bounded on each side by lofty barren mountains and although not broad 
it is very fertile numerous cottages were surrounded by vines and by
orchards of apple nectarine and peach-trees their boughs breaking
with the weight of the beautiful ripe fruit in the evening we passed
the custom-house where our luggage was examined the frontier of
chile is better guarded by the cordillera than by the waters of the
sea there are very few valleys which lead to the central ranges and
the mountains are quite impassable in other parts by beasts of burden 
the custom-house officers were very civil which was perhaps partly
owing to the passport which the president of the republic had given me 
but i must express my admiration at the natural politeness of almost
every chileno in this instance the contrast with the same class of
men in most other countries was strongly marked i may mention an
anecdote with which i was at the time much pleased we met near mendoza
a little and very fat negress riding astride on a mule she had a
 goitre so enormous that it was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at
her for a moment but my two companions almost instantly by way of
apology made the common salute of the country by taking off their
hats where would one of the lower or higher classes in europe have
shown such feeling politeness to a poor and miserable object of a
degraded race 

at night we slept at a cottage our manner of travelling was
delightfully independent in the inhabited parts we bought a little
firewood hired pasture for the animals and bivouacked in the corner
of the same field with them carrying an iron pot we cooked and ate
our supper under a cloudless sky and knew no trouble my companions
were mariano gonzales who had formerly accompanied me in chile and an
 arriero with his ten mules and a madrina the madrina or
godmother is a most important personage 

she is an old steady mare with a little bell round her neck and
wherever she goes the mules like good children follow her the
affection of these animals for their madrinas saves infinite trouble 
if several large troops are turned into one field to graze in the
morning the muleteers have only to lead the madrinas a little apart 
and tinkle their bells although there may be two or three hundred
together each mule immediately knows the bell of its own madrina and
comes to her it is nearly impossible to lose an old mule for if
detained for several hours by force she will by the power of smell 
like a dog track out her companions or rather the madrina for 
according to the muleteer she is the chief object of affection the
feeling however is not of an individual nature for i believe i am
right in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as a madrina in
a troop each animal carries on a level road a cargo weighing 
pounds more than stone but in a mountainous country pounds
less yet with what delicate slim limbs without any proportional bulk
of muscle these animals support so great a burden the mule always
appears to me a most surprising animal that a hybrid should possess
more reason memory obstinacy social affection powers of muscular
endurance and length of life than either of its parents seems to
indicate that art has here outdone nature of our ten animals six
were intended for riding and four for carrying cargoes each taking
turn about we carried a good deal of food in case we should be snowed
up as the season was rather late for passing the portillo 

march th we rode during this day to the last and therefore most
elevated house in the valley the number of inhabitants became
scanty but wherever water could be brought on the land it was very
fertile all the main valleys in the cordillera are characterized by
having on both sides a fringe or terrace of shingle and sand rudely
stratified and generally of considerable thickness these fringes
evidently once extended across the valleys and were united and the
bottoms of the valleys in northern chile where there are no streams 
are thus smoothly filled up on these fringes the roads are generally
carried for their surfaces are even and they rise with a very gentle
slope up the valleys hence also they are easily cultivated by
irrigation they may be traced up to a height of between and 
feet where they become hidden by the irregular piles of debris at
the lower end or mouths of the valleys they are continuously united to
those land-locked plains also formed of shingle at the foot of the
main cordillera which i have described in a former chapter as
characteristic of the scenery of chile and which were undoubtedly
deposited when the sea penetrated chile as it now does the more
southern coasts no one fact in the geology of south america 
interested me more than these terraces of rudely-stratified shingle 
they precisely resemble in composition the matter which the torrents in
each valley would deposit if they were checked in their course by any
cause such as entering a lake or arm of the sea but the torrents 
instead of depositing matter are now steadily at work wearing away
both the solid rock and these alluvial deposits along the whole line
of every main valley and side valley it is impossible here to give
the reasons but i am convinced that the shingle terraces were
accumulated during the gradual elevation of the cordillera by the
torrents delivering at successive levels their detritus on the
beachheads of long narrow arms of the sea first high up the valleys 
then lower and lower down as the land slowly rose if this be so and
i cannot doubt it the grand and broken chain of the cordillera 
instead of having been suddenly thrown up as was till lately the
universal and still is the common opinion of geologists has been
slowly upheaved in mass in the same gradual manner as the coasts of
the atlantic and pacific have risen within the recent period a
multitude of facts in the structure of the cordillera on this view
receive a simple explanation 

the rivers which flow in these valleys ought rather to be called
mountain-torrents their inclination is very great and their water
the colour of mud the roar which the maypu made as it rushed over
the great rounded fragments was like that of the sea amidst the din
of rushing waters the noise from the stones as they rattled one over
another was most distinctly audible even from a distance this
rattling noise night and day may be heard along the whole course of
the torrent the sound spoke eloquently to the geologist the
thousands and thousands of stones which striking against each other 
made the one dull uniform sound were all hurrying in one direction it
was like thinking on time where the minute that now glides past is
irrevocable so was it with these stones the ocean is their eternity 
and each note of that wild music told of one more step towards their
destiny 

it is not possible for the mind to comprehend except by a slow
process any effect which is produced by a cause repeated so often 
that the multiplier itself conveys an idea not more definite than the
savage implies when he points to the hairs of his head as often as i
have seen beds of mud sand and shingle accumulated to the thickness
of many thousand feet i have felt inclined to exclaim that causes 
such as the present rivers and the present beaches could never have
ground down and produced such masses but on the other hand when
listening to the rattling noise of these torrents and calling to mind
that whole races of animals have passed away from the face of the
earth and that during this whole period night and day these stones
have gone rattling onwards in their course i have thought to myself 
can any mountains any continent withstand such waste 

in this part of the valley the mountains on each side were from 
to or feet high with rounded outlines and steep bare flanks 
the general colour of the rock was dullish purple and the
stratification very distinct if the scenery was not beautiful it was
remarkable and grand we met during the day several herds of cattle 
which men were driving down from the higher valleys in the cordillera 
this sign of the approaching winter hurried our steps more than was
convenient for geologizing the house where we slept was situated at
the foot of a mountain on the summit of which are the mines of s 
pedro de nolasko sir f head marvels how mines have been discovered
in such extraordinary situations as the bleak summit of the mountain
of s pedro de nolasko in the first place metallic veins in this
country are generally harder than the surrounding strata hence during
the gradual wear of the hills they project above the surface of the
ground secondly almost every labourer especially in the northern
parts of chile understands something about the appearance of ores in
the great mining provinces of coquimbo and copiapo firewood is very
scarce and men search for it over every hill and dale and by this
means nearly all the richest mines have there been discovered 
chanuncillo from which silver to the value of many hundred thousand
pounds has been raised in the course of a few years was discovered by
a man who threw a stone at his loaded donkey and thinking that it was
very heavy he picked it up and found it full of pure silver the vein
occurred at no great distance standing up like a wedge of metal the
miners also taking a crowbar with them often wander on sundays over
the mountains in this south part of chile the men who drive cattle
into the cordillera and who frequent every ravine where there is a
little pasture are the usual discoverers 

th as we ascended the valley the vegetation with the exception of
a few pretty alpine flowers became exceedingly scanty and of
quadrupeds birds or insects scarcely one could be seen the lofty
mountains their summits marked with a few patches of snow stood well
separated from each other the valleys being filled up with an immense
thickness of stratified alluvium the features in the scenery of the
andes which struck me most as contrasted with the other mountain
chains with which i am acquainted were the flat fringes sometimes
expanding into narrow plains on each side of the valleys the bright
colours chiefly red and purple of the utterly bare and precipitous
hills of porphyry the grand and continuous wall-like dykes the
plainly-divided strata which where nearly vertical formed the
picturesque and wild central pinnacles but where less inclined 
composed the great massive mountains on the outskirts of the
range and lastly the smooth conical piles of fine and brightly
coloured detritus which sloped up at a high angle from the base of the
mountains sometimes to a height of more than feet 

i frequently observed both in tierra del fuego and within the andes 
that where the rock was covered during the greater part of the year
with snow it was shivered in a very extraordinary manner into small
angular fragments scoresby has observed the same fact in
spitzbergen the case appears to me rather obscure for that part of
the mountain which is protected by a mantle of snow must be less
subject to repeated and great changes of temperature than any other
part i have sometimes thought that the earth and fragments of stone
on the surface were perhaps less effectually removed by slowly
percolating snow-water than by rain and therefore that the
appearance of a quicker disintegration of the solid rock under the
snow was deceptive whatever the cause may be the quantity of
crumbling stone on the cordillera is very great occasionally in the
spring great masses of this detritus slide down the mountains and
cover the snow-drifts in the valleys thus forming natural ice-houses 
we rode over one the height of which was far below the limit of
perpetual snow 

as the evening drew to a close we reached a singular basin-like plain 
called the valle del yeso it was covered by a little dry pasture and
we had the pleasant sight of a herd of cattle amidst the surrounding
rocky deserts the valley takes its name of yeso from a great bed i
should think at least feet thick of white and in some parts
quite pure gypsum we slept with a party of men who were employed in
loading mules with this substance which is used in the manufacture of
wine we set out early in the morning st and continued to follow
the course of the river which had become very small till we arrived
at the foot of the ridge that separates the waters flowing into the
pacific and atlantic oceans the road which as yet had been good with
a steady but very gradual ascent now changed into a steep zigzag track
up the great range dividing the republics of chile and mendoza 

i will here give a very brief sketch of the geology of the several
parallel lines forming the cordillera of these lines there are two
considerably higher than the others namely on the chilian side the
peuquenes ridge which where the road crosses it is feet above
the sea and the portillo ridge on the mendoza side which is 
feet the lower beds of the peuquenes ridge and of the several great
lines to the westward of it are composed of a vast pile many thousand
feet in thickness of porphyries which have flowed as submarine lavas 
alternating with angular and rounded fragments of the same rocks 
thrown out of the submarine craters these alternating masses are
covered in the central parts by a great thickness of red sandstone 
conglomerate and calcareous clay-slate associated with and passing
into prodigious beds of gypsum in these upper beds shells are
tolerably frequent and they belong to about the period of the lower
chalk of europe it is an old story but not the less wonderful to
hear of shells which were once crawling on the bottom of the sea now
standing nearly feet above its level the lower beds in this
great pile of strata have been dislocated baked crystallized and
almost blended together through the agency of mountain masses of a
peculiar white soda-granitic rock 

the other main line namely that of the portillo is of a totally
different formation it consists chiefly of grand bare pinnacles of a
red potash-granite which low down on the western flank are covered by
a sandstone converted by the former heat into a quartz-rock on the
quartz there rest beds of a conglomerate several thousand feet in
thickness which have been upheaved by the red granite and dip at an
angle of degs towards the peuquenes line i was astonished to find
that this conglomerate was partly composed of pebbles derived from the
rocks with their fossil shells of the peuquenes range and partly of
red potash-granite like that of the portillo hence we must conclude 
that both the peuquenes and portillo ranges were partially upheaved and
exposed to wear and tear when the conglomerate was forming but as the
beds of the conglomerate have been thrown off at an angle of degs 
by the red portillo granite with the underlying sandstone baked by
it we may feel sure that the greater part of the injection and
upheaval of the already partially formed portillo line took place
after the accumulation of the conglomerate and long after the
elevation of the peuquenes ridge so that the portillo the loftiest
line in this part of the cordillera is not so old as the less lofty
line of the peuquenes evidence derived from an inclined stream of
lava at the eastern base of the portillo might be adduced to show 
that it owes part of its great height to elevations of a still later
date looking to its earliest origin the red granite seems to have
been injected on an ancient pre-existing line of white granite and
mica-slate in most parts perhaps in all parts of the cordillera it
may be concluded that each line has been formed by repeated upheavals
and injections and that the several parallel lines are of different
ages only thus can we gain time at all sufficient to explain the
truly astonishing amount of denudation which these great though
comparatively with most other ranges recent mountains have suffered 

finally the shells in the peuquenes or oldest ridge prove as before
remarked that it has been upraised feet since a secondary
period which in europe we are accustomed to consider as far from
ancient but since these shells lived in a moderately deep sea it can
be shown that the area now occupied by the cordillera must have
subsided several thousand feet in northern chile as much as 
feet so as to have allowed that amount of submarine strata to have
been heaped on the bed on which the shells lived the proof is the
same with that by which it was shown that at a much later period 
since the tertiary shells of patagonia lived there must have been
there a subsidence of several hundred feet as well as an ensuing
elevation daily it is forced home on the mind of the geologist that
nothing not even the wind that blows is so unstable as the level of
the crust of this earth 

i will make only one other geological remark although the portillo
chain is here higher than the peuquenes the waters draining the
intermediate valleys have burst through it the same fact on a
grander scale has been remarked in the eastern and loftiest line of
the bolivian cordillera through which the rivers pass analogous facts
have also been observed in other quarters of the world on the
supposition of the subsequent and gradual elevation of the portillo
line this can be understood for a chain of islets would at first
appear and as these were lifted up the tides would be always wearing
deeper and broader channels between them at the present day even in
the most retired sounds on the coast of tierra del fuego the currents
in the transverse breaks which connect the longitudinal channels are
very strong so that in one transverse channel even a small vessel
under sail was whirled round and round 


about noon we began the tedious ascent of the peuquenes ridge and then
for the first time experienced some little difficulty in our
respiration the mules would halt every fifty yards and after resting
for a few seconds the poor willing animals started of their own accord
again the short breathing from the rarefied atmosphere is called by
the chilenos puna and they have most ridiculous notions concerning
its origin some say all the waters here have puna others that
 where there is snow there is puna and this no doubt is true the
only sensation i experienced was a slight tightness across the head and
chest like that felt on leaving a warm room and running quickly in
frosty weather there was some imagination even in this for upon
finding fossil shells on the highest ridge i entirely forgot the puna
in my delight certainly the exertion of walking was extremely great 
and the respiration became deep and laborious i am told that in potosi
 about feet above the sea strangers do not become thoroughly
accustomed to the atmosphere for an entire year the inhabitants all
recommend onions for the puna as this vegetable has sometimes been
given in europe for pectoral complaints it may possibly be of real
service for my part i found nothing so good as the fossil shells 

when about half-way up we met a large party with seventy loaded mules 
it was interesting to hear the wild cries of the muleteers and to
watch the long descending string of the animals they appeared so
diminutive there being nothing but the black mountains with which they
could be compared when near the summit the wind as generally
happens was impetuous and extremely cold on each side of the ridge 
we had to pass over broad bands of perpetual snow which were now soon
to be covered by a fresh layer when we reached the crest and looked
backwards a glorious view was presented the atmosphere resplendently
clear the sky an intense blue the profound valleys the wild broken
forms the heaps of ruins piled up during the lapse of ages the
bright-coloured rocks contrasted with the quiet mountains of snow all
these together produced a scene no one could have imagined neither
plant nor bird excepting a few condors wheeling around the higher
pinnacles distracted my attention from the inanimate mass i felt
glad that i was alone it was like watching a thunderstorm or hearing
in full orchestra a chorus of the messiah 

on several patches of the snow i found the protococcus nivalis or red
snow so well known from the accounts of arctic navigators my
attention was called to it by observing the footsteps of the mules
stained a pale red as if their hoofs had been slightly bloody i at
first thought that it was owing to dust blown from the surrounding
mountains of red porphyry for from the magnifying power of the
crystals of snow the groups of these microscopical plants appeared
like coarse particles the snow was coloured only where it had thawed
very rapidly or had been accidentally crushed a little rubbed on
paper gave it a faint rose tinge mingled with a little brick-red i
afterwards scraped some off the paper and found that it consisted of
groups of little spheres in colourless cases each of the thousandth
part of an inch in diameter 

the wind on the crest of the peuquenes as just remarked is generally
impetuous and very cold it is said to blow steadily from the
westward or pacific side as the observations have been chiefly made
in summer this wind must be an upper and return current the peak of
teneriffe with a less elevation and situated in lat degs in
like manner falls within an upper return stream at first it appears
rather surprising that the trade-wind along the northern parts of
chile and on the coast of peru should blow in so very southerly a
direction as it does but when we reflect that the cordillera running
in a north and south line intercepts like a great wall the entire
depth of the lower atmospheric current we can easily see that the
trade-wind must be drawn northward following the line of mountains 
towards the equatorial regions and thus lose part of that easterly
movement which it otherwise would have gained from the earth s
rotation at mendoza on the eastern foot of the andes the climate is
said to be subject to long calms and to frequent though false
appearances of gathering rain-storms we may imagine that the wind 
which coming from the eastward is thus banked up by the line of
mountains would become stagnant and irregular in its movements 

having crossed the peuquenes we descended into a mountainous country 
intermediate between the two main ranges and then took up our quarters
for the night we were now in the republic of mendoza the elevation
was probably not under feet and the vegetation in consequence
exceedingly scanty the root of a small scrubby plant served as fuel 
but it made a miserable fire and the wind was piercingly cold being
quite tired with my days work i made up my bed as quickly as i could 
and went to sleep about midnight i observed the sky became suddenly
clouded i awakened the arriero to know if there was any danger of bad
weather but he said that without thunder and lightning there was no
risk of a heavy snow-storm the peril is imminent and the difficulty
of subsequent escape great to any one overtaken by bad weather between
the two ranges a certain cave offers the only place of refuge mr 
caldcleugh who crossed on this same day of the month was detained
there for some time by a heavy fall of snow casuchas or houses of
refuge have not been built in this pass as in that of uspallata and 
therefore during the autumn the portillo is little frequented i may
here remark that within the main cordillera rain never falls for
during the summer the sky is cloudless and in winter snow-storms alone
occur 

at the place where we slept water necessarily boiled from the
diminished pressure of the atmosphere at a lower temperature than it
does in a less lofty country the case being the converse of that of a
papin s digester hence the potatoes after remaining for some hours
in the boiling water were nearly as hard as ever the pot was left on
the fire all night and next morning it was boiled again but yet the
potatoes were not cooked i found out this by overhearing my two
companions discussing the cause they had come to the simple
conclusion that the cursed pot which was a new one did not choose
to boil potatoes 

march nd after eating our potatoless breakfast we travelled
across the intermediate tract to the foot of the portillo range in
the middle of summer cattle are brought up here to graze but they had
now all been removed even the greater number of the guanacos had
decamped knowing well that if overtaken here by a snow-storm they
would be caught in a trap we had a fine view of a mass of mountains
called tupungato the whole clothed with unbroken snow in the midst of
which there was a blue patch no doubt a glacier a circumstance of
rare occurrence in these mountains now commenced a heavy and long
climb similar to that of the peuquenes bold conical hills of red
granite rose on each hand in the valleys there were several broad
fields of perpetual snow these frozen masses during the process of
thawing had in some parts been converted into pinnacles or columns 
 which as they were high and close together made it difficult for
the cargo mules to pass on one of these columns of ice a frozen horse
was sticking as on a pedestal but with its hind legs straight up in
the air the animal i suppose must have fallen with its head
downward into a hole when the snow was continuous and afterwards the
surrounding parts must have been removed by the thaw 

when nearly on the crest of the portillo we were enveloped in a
falling cloud of minute frozen spicula this was very unfortunate as
it continued the whole day and quite intercepted our view the pass
takes its name of portillo from a narrow cleft or doorway on the
highest ridge through which the road passes from this point on a
clear day those vast plains which uninterruptedly extend to the
atlantic ocean can be seen we descended to the upper limit of
vegetation and found good quarters for the night under the shelter of
some large fragments of rock we met here some passengers who made
anxious inquiries about the state of the road shortly after it was
dark the clouds suddenly cleared away and the effect was quite
magical the great mountains bright with the full moon seemed
impending over us on all sides as over a deep crevice one morning 
very early i witnessed the same striking effect as soon as the
clouds were dispersed it froze severely but as there was no wind we
slept very comfortably 

the increased brilliancy of the moon and stars at this elevation owing
to the perfect transparency of the atmosphere was very remarkable 
travelers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and
distances amidst lofty mountains have generally attributed it to the
absence of objects of comparison it appears to me that it is fully
as much owing to the transparency of the air confounding objects at
different distances and likewise partly to the novelty of an unusual
degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion habit being thus
opposed to the evidence of the senses i am sure that this extreme
clearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the landscape all
objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane as in a drawing
or panorama the transparency is i presume owing to the equable and
high state of atmospheric dryness this dryness was shown by the
manner in which woodwork shrank as i soon found by the trouble my
geological hammer gave me by articles of food such as bread and
sugar becoming extremely hard and by the preservation of the skin and
parts of the flesh of the beasts which had perished on the road to
the same cause we must attribute the singular facility with which
electricity is excited my flannel waistcoat when rubbed in the dark 
appeared as if it had been washed with phosphorus every hair on a
dog s back crackled even the linen sheets and leathern straps of the
saddle when handled emitted sparks 

march rd the descent on the eastern side of the cordillera is much
shorter or steeper than on the pacific side in other words the
mountains rise more abruptly from the plains than from the alpine
country of chile a level and brilliantly white sea of clouds was
stretched out beneath our feet shutting out the view of the equally
level pampas we soon entered the band of clouds and did not again
emerge from it that day about noon finding pasture for the animals
and bushes for firewood at los arenales we stopped for the night this
was near the uppermost limit of bushes and the elevation i suppose 
was between seven and eight thousand feet 

i was much struck with the marked difference between the vegetation of
these eastern valleys and those on the chilian side yet the climate 
as well as the kind of soil is nearly the same and the difference of
longitude very trifling the same remark holds good with the
quadrupeds and in a lesser degree with the birds and insects i may
instance the mice of which i obtained thirteen species on the shores
of the atlantic and five on the pacific and not one of them is
identical we must except all those species which habitually or
occasionally frequent elevated mountains and certain birds which
range as far south as the strait of magellan this fact is in perfect
accordance with the geological history of the andes for these
mountains have existed as a great barrier since the present races of
animals have appeared and therefore unless we suppose the same
species to have been created in two different places we ought not to
expect any closer similarity between the organic beings on the opposite
sides of the andes than on the opposite shores of the ocean in both
cases we must leave out of the question those kinds which have been
able to cross the barrier whether of solid rock or salt-water 

a great number of the plants and animals were absolutely the same as 
or most closely allied to those of patagonia we here have the agouti 
bizcacha three species of armadillo the ostrich certain kinds of
partridges and other birds none of which are ever seen in chile but
are the characteristic animals of the desert plains of patagonia we
have likewise many of the same to the eyes of a person who is not a
botanist thorny stunted bushes withered grass and dwarf plants even
the black slowly crawling beetles are closely similar and some i
believe on rigorous examination absolutely identical it had always
been to me a subject of regret that we were unavoidably compelled to
give up the ascent of the s cruz river before reaching the mountains 
i always had a latent hope of meeting with some great change in the
features of the country but i now feel sure that it would only have
been following the plains of patagonia up a mountainous ascent 

march th early in the morning i climbed up a mountain on one side
of the valley and enjoyed a far extended view over the pampas this
was a spectacle to which i had always looked forward with interest but
i was disappointed at the first glance it much resembled a distant
view of the ocean but in the northern parts many irregularities were
soon distinguishable the most striking feature consisted in the
rivers which facing the rising sun glittered like silver threads 
till lost in the immensity of the distance at midday we descended the
valley and reached a hovel where an officer and three soldiers were
posted to examine passports one of these men was a thoroughbred pampas
indian he was kept much for the same purpose as a bloodhound to track
out any person who might pass by secretly either on foot or horseback 
some years ago a passenger endeavoured to escape detection by making
a long circuit over a neighbouring mountain but this indian having by
chance crossed his track followed it for the whole day over dry and
very stony hills till at last he came on his prey hidden in a gully 
we here heard that the silvery clouds which we had admired from the
bright region above had poured down torrents of rain the valley from
this point gradually opened and the hills became mere water-worn
hillocks compared to the giants behind it then expanded into a gently
sloping plain of shingle covered with low trees and bushes this
talus although appearing narrow must be nearly ten miles wide before
it blends into the apparently dead level pampas we passed the only
house in this neighbourhood the estancia of chaquaio and at sunset we
pulled up in the first snug corner and there bivouacked 

march th i was reminded of the pampas of buenos ayres by seeing
the disk of the rising sun intersected by an horizon level as that of
the ocean during the night a heavy dew fell a circumstance which we
did not experience within the cordillera the road proceeded for some
distance due east across a low swamp then meeting the dry plain it
turned to the north towards mendoza the distance is two very long
days journey our first day s journey was called fourteen leagues to
estacado and the second seventeen to luxan near mendoza the whole
distance is over a level desert plain with not more than two or three
houses the sun was exceedingly powerful and the ride devoid of all
interest there is very little water in this traversia and in our
second day s journey we found only one little pool little water flows
from the mountains and it soon becomes absorbed by the dry and porous
soil so that although we travelled at the distance of only ten or
fifteen miles from the outer range of the cordillera we did not cross
a single stream in many parts the ground was incrusted with a saline
efflorescence hence we had the same salt-loving plants which are
common near bahia blanca the landscape has a uniform character from
the strait of magellan along the whole eastern coast of patagonia to
the rio colorado and it appears that the same kind of country extends
inland from this river in a sweeping line as far as san luis and
perhaps even further north to the eastward of this curved line lies
the basin of the comparatively damp and green plains of buenos ayres 
the sterile plains of mendoza and patagonia consist of a bed of
shingle worn smooth and accumulated by the waves of the sea while the
pampas covered by thistles clover and grass have been formed by the
ancient estuary mud of the plata 

after our two days tedious journey it was refreshing to see in the
distance the rows of poplars and willows growing round the village and
river of luxan shortly before we arrived at this place we observed
to the south a ragged cloud of dark reddish-brown colour at first we
thought that it was smoke from some great fire on the plains but we
soon found that it was a swarm of locusts they were flying northward 
and with the aid of a light breeze they overtook us at a rate of ten
or fifteen miles an hour the main body filled the air from a height
of twenty feet to that as it appeared of two or three thousand above
the ground and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots
of many horses running to battle or rather i should say like a
strong breeze passing through the rigging of a ship the sky seen
through the advanced guard appeared like a mezzotinto engraving but
the main body was impervious to sight they were not however so thick
together but that they could escape a stick waved backwards and
forwards when they alighted they were more numerous than the leaves
in the field and the surface became reddish instead of being green 
the swarm having once alighted the individuals flew from side to side
in all directions locusts are not an uncommon pest in this country 
already during the season several smaller swarms had come up from the
south where as apparently in all other parts of the world they are
bred in the deserts the poor cottagers in vain attempted by lighting
fires by shouts and by waving branches to avert the attack this
species of locust closely resembles and perhaps is identical with the
famous gryllus migratorius of the east 

we crossed the luxan which is a river of considerable size though its
course towards the sea-coast is very imperfectly known it is even
doubtful whether in passing over the plains it is not evaporated and
lost we slept in the village of luxan which is a small place
surrounded by gardens and forms the most southern cultivated district
in the province of mendoza it is five leagues south of the capital at
night i experienced an attack for it deserves no less a name of the
 benchuca a species of reduvius the great black bug of the pampas 
it is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects about an inch
long crawling over one s body before sucking they are quite thin 
but afterwards they become round and bloated with blood and in this
state are easily crushed one which i caught at iquique for they are
found in chile and peru was very empty when placed on a table and
though surrounded by people if a finger was presented the bold insect
would immediately protrude its sucker make a charge and if allowed 
draw blood no pain was caused by the wound it was curious to watch
its body during the act of sucking as in less than ten minutes it
changed from being as flat as a wafer to a globular form this one
feast for which the benchuca was indebted to one of the officers kept
it fat during four whole months but after the first fortnight it was
quite ready to have another suck 

march th we rode on to mendoza the country was beautifully
cultivated and resembled chile this neighbourhood is celebrated for
its fruit and certainly nothing could appear more flourishing than the
vineyards and the orchards of figs peaches and olives we bought
water-melons nearly twice as large as a man s head most deliciously
cool and well-flavoured for a halfpenny apiece and for the value of
threepence half a wheelbarrowful of peaches the cultivated and
enclosed part of this province is very small there is little more than
that which we passed through between luxan and the capital the land 
as in chile owes its fertility entirely to artificial irrigation and
it is really wonderful to observe how extraordinarily productive a
barren traversia is thus rendered 

we stayed the ensuing day in mendoza the prosperity of the place has
much declined of late years the inhabitants say it is good to live
in but very bad to grow rich in the lower orders have the lounging 
reckless manners of the gauchos of the pampas and their dress 
riding-gear and habits of life are nearly the same to my mind the
town had a stupid forlorn aspect neither the boasted alameda nor
the scenery is at all comparable with that of santiago but to those
who coming from buenos ayres have just crossed the unvaried pampas 
the gardens and orchards must appear delightful sir f head speaking
of the inhabitants says they eat their dinners and it is so very
hot they go to sleep and could they do better i quite agree with
sir f head the happy doom of the mendozinos is to eat sleep and be
idle 


march th we set out on our return to chile by the uspallata pass
situated north of mendoza we had to cross a long and most sterile
traversia of fifteen leagues the soil in parts was absolutely bare 
in others covered by numberless dwarf cacti armed with formidable
spines and called by the inhabitants little lions there were also 
a few low bushes although the plain is nearly three thousand feet
above the sea the sun was very powerful and the heat as well as the
clouds of impalpable dust rendered the travelling extremely irksome 
our course during the day lay nearly parallel to the cordillera but
gradually approaching them before sunset we entered one of the wide
valleys or rather bays which open on the plain this soon narrowed
into a ravine where a little higher up the house of villa vicencio is
situated as we had ridden all day without a drop of water both our
mules and selves were very thirsty and we looked out anxiously for the
stream which flows down this valley it was curious to observe how
gradually the water made its appearance on the plain the course was
quite dry by degrees it became a little damper then puddles of water
appeared these soon became connected and at villa vicencio there was
a nice little rivulet 

th the solitary hovel which bears the imposing name of villa
vicencio has been mentioned by every traveller who has crossed the
andes i stayed here and at some neighbouring mines during the two
succeeding days the geology of the surrounding country is very
curious the uspallata range is separated from the main cordillera by
a long narrow plain or basin like those so often mentioned in chile 
but higher being six thousand feet above the sea this range has
nearly the same geographical position with respect to the cordillera 
which the gigantic portillo line has but it is of a totally different
origin it consists of various kinds of submarine lava alternating
with volcanic sandstones and other remarkable sedimentary deposits the
whole having a very close resemblance to some of the tertiary beds on
the shores of the pacific from this resemblance i expected to find
silicified wood which is generally characteristic of those formations 
i was gratified in a very extraordinary manner in the central part of
the range at an elevation of about seven thousand feet i observed on
a bare slope some snow-white projecting columns these were petrified
trees eleven being silicified and from thirty to forty converted into
coarsely-crystallized white calcareous spar they were abruptly broken
off the upright stumps projecting a few feet above the ground the
trunks measured from three to five feet each in circumference they
stood a little way apart from each other but the whole formed one
group mr robert brown has been kind enough to examine the wood he
says it belongs to the fir tribe partaking of the character of the
araucarian family but with some curious points of affinity with the
yew the volcanic sandstone in which the trees were embedded and from
the lower part of which they must have sprung had accumulated in
successive thin layers around their trunks and the stone yet retained
the impression of the bark 

it required little geological practice to interpret the marvellous
story which this scene at once unfolded though i confess i was at
first so much astonished that i could scarcely believe the plainest
evidence i saw the spot where a cluster of fine trees once waved
their branches on the shores of the atlantic when that ocean now
driven back miles came to the foot of the andes i saw that they
had sprung from a volcanic soil which had been raised above the level
of the sea and that subsequently this dry land with its upright
trees had been let down into the depths of the ocean in these
depths the formerly dry land was covered by sedimentary beds and
these again by enormous streams of submarine lava one such mass
attaining the thickness of a thousand feet and these deluges of molten
stone and aqueous deposits five times alternately had been spread out 
the ocean which received such thick masses must have been profoundly
deep but again the subterranean forces exerted themselves and i now
beheld the bed of that ocean forming a chain of mountains more than
seven thousand feet in height nor had those antagonistic forces been
dormant which are always at work wearing down the surface of the land 
the great piles of strata had been intersected by many wide valleys 
and the trees now changed into silex were exposed projecting from the
volcanic soil now changed into rock whence formerly in a green and
budding state they had raised their lofty heads now all is utterly
irreclaimable and desert even the lichen cannot adhere to the stony
casts of former trees vast and scarcely comprehensible as such
changes must ever appear yet they have all occurred within a period 
recent when compared with the history of the cordillera and the
cordillera itself is absolutely modern as compared with many of the
fossiliferous strata of europe and america 

april st we crossed the upsallata range and at night slept at the
custom-house the only inhabited spot on the plain shortly before
leaving the mountains there was a very extraordinary view red 
purple green and quite white sedimentary rocks alternating with
black lavas were broken up and thrown into all kinds of disorder by
masses of porphyry of every shade of colour from dark brown to the
brightest lilac it was the first view i ever saw which really
resembled those pretty sections which geologists make of the inside of
the earth 

the next day we crossed the plain and followed the course of the same
great mountain stream which flows by luxan here it was a furious
torrent quite impassable and appeared larger than in the low country 
as was the case with the rivulet of villa vicencio on the evening of
the succeeding day we reached the rio de las vacas which is
considered the worst stream in the cordillera to cross as all these
rivers have a rapid and short course and are formed by the melting of
the snow the hour of the day makes a considerable difference in their
volume in the evening the stream is muddy and full but about
daybreak it becomes clearer and much less impetuous this we found to
be the case with the rio vacas and in the morning we crossed it with
little difficulty 

the scenery thus far was very uninteresting compared with that of the
portillo pass little can be seen beyond the bare walls of the one
grand flat-bottomed valley which the road follows up to the highest
crest the valley and the huge rocky mountains are extremely barren 
during the two previous nights the poor mules had absolutely nothing to
eat for excepting a few low resinous bushes scarcely a plant can be
seen in the course of this day we crossed some of the worst passes in
the cordillera but their danger has been much exaggerated i was told
that if i attempted to pass on foot my head would turn giddy and that
there was no room to dismount but i did not see a place where any one
might not have walked over backwards or got off his mule on either
side one of the bad passes called las animas the souls i had
crossed and did not find out till a day afterwards that it was one of
the awful dangers no doubt there are many parts in which if the mule
should stumble the rider would be hurled down a great precipice but
of this there is little chance i dare say in the spring the
 laderas or roads which each year are formed anew across the piles
of fallen detritus are very bad but from what i saw i suspect the
real danger is nothing with cargo-mules the case is rather different 
for the loads project so far that the animals occasionally running
against each other or against a point of rock lose their balance and
are thrown down the precipices in crossing the rivers i can well
believe that the difficulty may be very great at this season there was
little trouble but in the summer they must be very hazardous i can
quite imagine as sir f head describes the different expressions of
those who have passed the gulf and those who are passing i never
heard of any man being drowned but with loaded mules it frequently
happens the arriero tells you to show your mule the best line and
then allow her to cross as she likes the cargo-mule takes a bad line 
and is often lost 

april th from the rio de las vacas to the puente del incas half a
day s journey as there was pasture for the mules and geology for me 
we bivouacked here for the night when one hears of a natural bridge 
one pictures to one s self some deep and narrow ravine across which a
bold mass of rock has fallen or a great arch hollowed out like the
vault of a cavern instead of this the incas bridge consists of a
crust of stratified shingle cemented together by the deposits of the
neighbouring hot springs it appears as if the stream had scooped out
a channel on one side leaving an overhanging ledge which was met by
earth and stones falling down from the opposite cliff certainly an
oblique junction as would happen in such a case was very distinct on
one side the bridge of the incas is by no means worthy of the great
monarchs whose name it bears 

th we had a long day s ride across the central ridge from the incas
bridge to the ojos del agua which are situated near the lowest
 casucha on the chilian side these casuchas are round little towers 
with steps outside to reach the floor which is raised some feet above
the ground on account of the snow-drifts they are eight in number 
and under the spanish government were kept during the winter well
stored with food and charcoal and each courier had a master-key now
they only answer the purpose of caves or rather dungeons seated on
some little eminence they are not however ill suited to the
surrounding scene of desolation the zigzag ascent of the cumbre or
the partition of the waters was very steep and tedious its height 
according to mr pentland is feet the road did not pass over
any perpetual snow although there were patches of it on both hands 
the wind on the summit was exceedingly cold but it was impossible not
to stop for a few minutes to admire again and again the colour of the
heavens and the brilliant transparency of the atmosphere the scenery
was grand to the westward there was a fine chaos of mountains divided
by profound ravines some snow generally falls before this period of
the season and it has even happened that the cordillera have been
finally closed by this time but we were most fortunate the sky by
night and by day was cloudless excepting a few round little masses of
vapour that floated over the highest pinnacles i have often seen
these islets in the sky marking the position of the cordillera when
the far-distant mountains have been hidden beneath the horizon 

april th in the morning we found some thief had stolen one of our
mules and the bell of the madrina we therefore rode only two or
three miles down the valley and stayed there the ensuing day in hopes
of recovering the mule which the arriero thought had been hidden in
some ravine the scenery in this part had assumed a chilian character 
the lower sides of the mountains dotted over with the pale evergreen
quillay tree and with the great chandelier-like cactus are certainly
more to be admired than the bare eastern valleys but i cannot quite
agree with the admiration expressed by some travellers the extreme
pleasure i suspect is chiefly owing to the prospect of a good fire
and of a good supper after escaping from the cold regions above and i
am sure i most heartily participated in these feelings 

th we left the valley of the aconcagua by which we had descended 
and reached in the evening a cottage near the villa del st rosa the
fertility of the plain was delightful the autumn being advanced the
leaves of many of the fruit-trees were falling and of the
labourers some were busy in drying figs and peaches on the roofs of
their cottages while others were gathering the grapes from the
vineyards it was a pretty scene but i missed that pensive stillness
which makes the autumn in england indeed the evening of the year on
the th we reached santiago where i received a very kind and
hospitable reception from mr caldcleugh my excursion only cost me
twenty-four days and never did i more deeply enjoy an equal space of
time a few days afterwards i returned to mr corfield s house at

april th i set out on a journey to coquimbo and thence through
guasco to copiapo where captain fitz roy kindly offered to pick me up
in the beagle the distance in a straight line along the shore
northward is only miles but my mode of travelling made it a very
long journey i bought four horses and two mules the latter carrying
the luggage on alternate days the six animals together only cost the
value of twenty-five pounds sterling and at copiapo i sold them again
for twenty-three we travelled in the same independent manner as
before cooking our own meals and sleeping in the open air as we
rode towards the vino del mar i took a farewell view of valparaiso 
and admired its picturesque appearance for geological purposes i made
a detour from the high road to the foot of the bell of quillota we
passed through an alluvial district rich in gold to the neighbourhood
of limache where we slept washing for gold supports the inhabitants
of numerous hovels scattered along the sides of each little rivulet 
but like all those whose gains are uncertain they are unthrifty in
all their habits and consequently poor 

th in the afternoon we arrived at a cottage at the foot of the bell
mountain the inhabitants were freeholders which is not very usual in
chile they supported themselves on the produce of a garden and a
little field but were very poor capital is here so deficient that
the people are obliged to sell their green corn while standing in the
field in order to buy necessaries for the ensuing year wheat in
consequence was dearer in the very district of its production than at
valparaiso where the contractors live the next day we joined the
main road to coquimbo at night there was a very light shower of rain 
this was the first drop that had fallen since the heavy rain of
september th and th which detained me a prisoner at the baths of
cauquenes the interval was seven and a half months but the rain this
year in chile was rather later than usual the distant andes were now
covered by a thick mass of snow and were a glorious sight 

may nd the road continued to follow the coast at no great distance
from the sea the few trees and bushes which are common in central
chile decreased rapidly in numbers and were replaced by a tall plant 
something like a yucca in appearance the surface of the country on a
small scale was singularly broken and irregular abrupt little peaks
of rock rising out of small plains or basins the indented coast and
the bottom of the neighbouring sea studded with breakers would if
converted into dry land present similar forms and such a conversion
without doubt has taken place in the part over which we rode 

rd quilimari to conchalee the country became more and more barren 
in the valleys there was scarcely sufficient water for any irrigation 
and the intermediate land was quite bare not supporting even goats in
the spring after the winter showers a thin pasture rapidly springs
up and cattle are then driven down from the cordillera to graze for a
short time it is curious to observe how the seeds of the grass and
other plants seem to accommodate themselves as if by an acquired
habit to the quantity of rain which falls upon different parts of this
coast one shower far northward at copiapo produces as great an effect
on the vegetation as two at guasco and three or four in this
district at valparaiso a winter so dry as greatly to injure the
pasture would at guasco produce the most unusual abundance proceeding
northward the quantity of rain does not appear to decrease in strict
proportion to the latitude at conchalee which is only miles north
of valparaiso rain is not expected till the end of may whereas at
valparaiso some generally falls early in april the annual quantity is
likewise small in proportion to the lateness of the season at which it
commences 

th finding the coast-road devoid of interest of any kind we turned
inland towards the mining district and valley of illapel this valley 
like every other in chile is level broad and very fertile it is
bordered on each side either by cliffs of stratified shingle or by
bare rocky mountains above the straight line of the uppermost
irrigating ditch all is brown as on a high road while all below is of
as bright a green as verdigris from the beds of alfalfa a kind of
clover we proceeded to los hornos another mining district where the
principal hill was drilled with holes like a great ants-nest the
chilian miners are a peculiar race of men in their habits living for
weeks together in the most desolate spots when they descend to the
villages on feast-days there is no excess of extravagance into which
they do not run they sometimes gain a considerable sum and then 
like sailors with prize-money they try how soon they can contrive to
squander it they drink excessively buy quantities of clothes and in
a few days return penniless to their miserable abodes there to work
harder than beasts of burden this thoughtlessness as with sailors 
is evidently the result of a similar manner of life their daily food
is found them and they acquire no habits of carefulness moreover 
temptation and the means of yielding to it are placed in their power at
the same time on the other hand in cornwall and some other parts of
england where the system of selling part of the vein is followed the
miners from being obliged to act and think for themselves are a
singularly intelligent and well-conducted set of men 

the dress of the chilian miner is peculiar and rather picturesque he
wears a very long shirt of some dark-coloured baize with a leathern
apron the whole being fastened round his waist by a bright-coloured
sash his trousers are very broad and his small cap of scarlet cloth
is made to fit the head closely we met a party of these miners in
full costume carrying the body of one of their companions to be
buried they marched at a very quick trot four men supporting the
corpse one set having run as hard as they could for about two hundred
yards were relieved by four others who had previously dashed on ahead
on horseback thus they proceeded encouraging each other by wild
cries altogether the scene formed a most strange funeral 

we continued travelling northward in a zigzag line sometimes stopping
a day to geologize the country was so thinly inhabited and the track
so obscure that we often had difficulty in finding our way on the
th i stayed at some mines the ore in this case was not considered
particularly good but from being abundant it was supposed the mine
would sell for about thirty or forty thousand dollars that is or
 pounds sterling yet it had been bought by one of the english
associations for an ounce of gold l s the ore is yellow
pyrites which as i have already remarked before the arrival of the
english was not supposed to contain a particle of copper on a scale
of profits nearly as great as in the above instance piles of cinders 
abounding with minute globules of metallic copper were purchased yet
with these advantages the mining associations as is well known 
contrived to lose immense sums of money the folly of the greater
number of the commissioners and shareholders amounted to
infatuation a thousand pounds per annum given in some cases to
entertain the chilian authorities libraries of well-bound geological
books miners brought out for particular metals as tin which are not
found in chile contracts to supply the miners with milk in parts
where there are no cows machinery where it could not possibly be
used and a hundred similar arrangements bore witness to our
absurdity and to this day afford amusement to the natives yet there
can be no doubt that the same capital well employed in these mines
would have yielded an immense return a confidential man of business a
practical miner and assayer would have been all that was required 

captain head has described the wonderful load which the apires truly
beasts of burden carry up from the deepest mines i confess i thought
the account exaggerated so that i was glad to take an opportunity of
weighing one of the loads which i picked out by hazard it required
considerable exertion on my part when standing directly over it to
lift it from the ground the load was considered under weight when
found to be pounds the apire had carried this up eighty
perpendicular yards part of the way by a steep passage but the
greater part up notched poles placed in a zigzag line up the shaft 
according to the general regulation the apire is not allowed to halt
for breath except the mine is six hundred feet deep the average load
is considered as rather more than pounds and i have been assured
that one of pounds twenty-two stone and a half by way of a trial
has been brought up from the deepest mine at this time the apires were
bringing up the usual load twelve times in the day that is pounds
from eighty yards deep and they were employed in the intervals in
breaking and picking ore 

these men excepting from accidents are healthy and appear cheerful 
their bodies are not very muscular they rarely eat meat once a week 
and never oftener and then only the hard dry charqui although with a
knowledge that the labour was voluntary it was nevertheless quite
revolting to see the state in which they reached the mouth of the mine 
their bodies bent forward leaning with their arms on the steps their
legs bowed their muscles quivering the perspiration streaming from
their faces over their breasts their nostrils distended the corners
of their mouth forcibly drawn back and the expulsion of their breath
most laborious each time they draw their breath they utter an
articulate cry of ay-ay which ends in a sound rising from deep in
the chest but shrill like the note of a fife after staggering to the
pile of ore they emptied the carpacho in two or three seconds
recovering their breath they wiped the sweat from their brows and
apparently quite fresh descended the mine again at a quick pace this
appears to me a wonderful instance of the amount of labour which habit 
for it can be nothing else will enable a man to endure 

in the evening talking with the mayor-domo of these mines about the
number of foreigners now scattered over the whole country he told me
that though quite a young man he remembers when he was a boy at
school at coquimbo a holiday being given to see the captain of an
english ship who was brought to the city to speak to the governor he
believes that nothing would have induced any boy in the school himself
included to have gone close to the englishman so deeply had they been
impressed with an idea of the heresy contamination and evil to be
derived from contact with such a person to this day they relate the
atrocious actions of the bucaniers and especially of one man who took
away the figure of the virgin mary and returned the year after for
that of st joseph saying it was a pity the lady should not have a
husband i heard also of an old lady who at a dinner at coquimbo 
remarked how wonderfully strange it was that she should have lived to
dine in the same room with an englishman for she remembered as a girl 
that twice at the mere cry of los ingleses every soul carrying
what valuables they could had taken to the mountains 

th we reached coquimbo where we stayed a few days the town is
remarkable for nothing but its extreme quietness it is said to
contain from to inhabitants on the morning of the th it
rained lightly the first time this year for about five hours the
farmers who plant corn near the sea-coast where the atmosphere is most
humid taking advantage of this shower would break up the ground 
after a second they would put the seed in and if a third shower should
fall they would reap a good harvest in the spring it was interesting
to watch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture twelve hours
afterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever yet after an interval of
ten days all the hills were faintly tinged with green patches the
grass being sparingly scattered in hair-like fibres a full inch in
length before this shower every part of the surface was bare as on a
high road 

in the evening captain fitz roy and myself were dining with mr 
edwards an english resident well known for his hospitality by all who
have visited coquimbo when a sharp earthquake happened i heard the
forecoming rumble but from the screams of the ladies the running of
the servants and the rush of several of the gentlemen to the doorway 
i could not distinguish the motion some of the women afterwards were
crying with terror and one gentleman said he should not be able to
sleep all night or if he did it would only be to dream of falling
houses the father of this person had lately lost all his property at
talcahuano and he himself had only just escaped a falling roof at
valparaiso in he mentioned a curious coincidence which then
happened he was playing at cards when a german one of the party got
up and said he would never sit in a room in these countries with the
door shut as owing to his having done so he had nearly lost his life
at copiapo accordingly he opened the door and no sooner had he done
this than he cried out here it comes again and the famous shock
commenced the whole party escaped the danger in an earthquake is
not from the time lost in opening the door but from the chance of its
becoming jammed by the movement of the walls 

it is impossible to be much surprised at the fear which natives and old
residents though some of them known to be men of great command of
mind so generally experience during earthquakes i think however 
this excess of panic may be partly attributed to a want of habit in
governing their fear as it is not a feeling they are ashamed of 
indeed the natives do not like to see a person indifferent i heard
of two englishmen who sleeping in the open air during a smart shock 
knowing that there was no danger did not rise the natives cried out
indignantly look at those heretics they do not even get out of their
beds 


i spent some days in examining the step-formed terraces of shingle 
first noticed by captain b hall and believed by mr lyell to have
been formed by the sea during the gradual rising of the land this
certainly is the true explanation for i found numerous shells of
existing species on these terraces five narrow gently sloping 
fringe-like terraces rise one behind the other and where best
developed are formed of shingle they front the bay and sweep up both
sides of the valley at guasco north of coquimbo the phenomenon is
displayed on a much grander scale so as to strike with surprise even
some of the inhabitants the terraces are there much broader and may
be called plains in some parts there are six of them but generally
only five they run up the valley for thirty-seven miles from the
coast these step-formed terraces or fringes closely resemble those in
the valley of s cruz and except in being on a smaller scale those
great ones along the whole coast-line of patagonia they have
undoubtedly been formed by the denuding power of the sea during long
periods of rest in the gradual elevation of the continent 

shells of many existing species not only lie on the surface of the
terraces at coquimbo to a height of feet but are embedded in a
friable calcareous rock which in some places is as much as between
twenty and thirty feet in thickness but is of little extent these
modern beds rest on an ancient tertiary formation containing shells 
apparently all extinct although i examined so many hundred miles of
coast on the pacific as well as atlantic side of the continent i
found no regular strata containing sea-shells of recent species 
excepting at this place and at a few points northward on the road to
guasco this fact appears to me highly remarkable for the explanation
generally given by geologists of the absence in any district of
stratified fossiliferous deposits of a given period namely that the
surface then existed as dry land is not here applicable for we know
from the shells strewed on the surface and embedded in loose sand or
mould that the land for thousands of miles along both coasts has lately
been submerged the explanation no doubt must be sought in the fact 
that the whole southern part of the continent has been for a long time
slowly rising and therefore that all matter deposited along shore in
shallow water must have been soon brought up and slowly exposed to the
wearing action of the sea-beach and it is only in comparatively
shallow water that the greater number of marine organic beings can
flourish and in such water it is obviously impossible that strata of
any great thickness can accumulate to show the vast power of the
wearing action of sea-beaches we need only appeal to the great cliffs
along the present coast of patagonia and to the escarpments or ancient
sea-cliffs at different levels one above another on that same line of
coast 

the old underlying tertiary formation at coquimbo appears to be of
about the same age with several deposits on the coast of chile of
which that of navedad is the principal one and with the great
formation of patagonia both at navedad and in patagonia there is
evidence that since the shells a list of which has been seen by
professor e forbes there entombed were living there has been a
subsidence of several hundred feet as well as an ensuing elevation it
may naturally be asked how it comes that although no extensive
fossiliferous deposits of the recent period nor of any period
intermediate between it and the ancient tertiary epoch have been
preserved on either side of the continent yet that at this ancient
tertiary epoch sedimentary matter containing fossil remains should
have been deposited and preserved at different points in north and
south lines over a space of miles on the shores of the pacific 
and of at least miles on the shores of the atlantic and in an
east and west line of miles across the widest part of the
continent i believe the explanation is not difficult and that it is
perhaps applicable to nearly analogous facts observed in other quarters
of the world considering the enormous power of denudation which the
sea possesses as shown by numberless facts it is not probable that a
sedimentary deposit when being upraised could pass through the ordeal
of the beach so as to be preserved in sufficient masses to last to a
distant period without it were originally of wide extent and of
considerable thickness now it is impossible on a moderately shallow
bottom which alone is favourable to most living creatures that a
thick and widely extended covering of sediment could be spread out 
without the bottom sank down to receive the successive layers this
seems to have actually taken place at about the same period in southern
patagonia and chile though these places are a thousand miles apart 
hence if prolonged movements of approximately contemporaneous
subsidence are generally widely extensive as i am strongly inclined to
believe from my examination of the coral reefs of the great oceans or
if confining our view to south america the subsiding movements have
been co-extensive with those of elevation by which within the same
period of existing shells the shores of peru chile tierra del fuego 
patagonia and la plata have been upraised then we can see that at the
same time at far distant points circumstances would have been
favourable to the formation of fossiliferous deposits of wide extent
and of considerable thickness and such deposits consequently would
have a good chance of resisting the wear and tear of successive
beach-lines and of lasting to a future epoch 


may st i set out in company with don jose edwards to the
silver-mine of arqueros and thence up the valley of coquimbo passing
through a mountainous country we reached by nightfall the mines
belonging to mr edwards i enjoyed my night s rest here from a reason
which will not be fully appreciated in england namely the absence of
fleas the rooms in coquimbo swarm with them but they will not live
here at the height of only three or four thousand feet it can scarcely
be the trifling diminution of temperature but some other cause which
destroys these troublesome insects at this place the mines are now in
a bad state though they formerly yielded about pounds in weight
of silver a year it has been said that a person with a copper-mine
will gain with silver he may gain but with gold he is sure to lose 
this is not true all the large chilian fortunes have been made by
mines of the more precious metals a short time since an english
physician returned to england from copiapo taking with him the profits
of one share of a silver-mine which amounted to about pounds
sterling no doubt a copper-mine with care is a sure game whereas the
other is gambling or rather taking a ticket in a lottery the owners
lose great quantities of rich ores for no precautions can prevent
robberies i heard of a gentleman laying a bet with another that one
of his men should rob him before his face the ore when brought out of
the mine is broken into pieces and the useless stone thrown on one
side a couple of the miners who were thus employed pitched as if by
accident two fragments away at the same moment and then cried out for
a joke let us see which rolls furthest the owner who was standing
by bet a cigar with his friend on the race the miner by this means
watched the very point amongst the rubbish where the stone lay in the
evening he picked it up and carried it to his master showing him a
rich mass of silver-ore and saying this was the stone on which you
won a cigar by its rolling so far 

may rd we descended into the fertile valley of coquimbo and
followed it till we reached an hacienda belonging to a relation of don
jose where we stayed the next day i then rode one day s journey
further to see what were declared to be some petrified shells and
beans which latter turned out to be small quartz pebbles we passed
through several small villages and the valley was beautifully
cultivated and the whole scenery very grand we were here near the
main cordillera and the surrounding hills were lofty in all parts of
northern chile fruit trees produce much more abundantly at a
considerable height near the andes than in the lower country the figs
and grapes of this district are famous for their excellence and are
cultivated to a great extent this valley is perhaps the most
productive one north of quillota i believe it contains including
coquimbo inhabitants the next day i returned to the hacienda 
and thence together with don jose to coquimbo 

june nd we set out for the valley of guasco following the
coast-road which was considered rather less desert than the other our
first day s ride was to a solitary house called yerba buena where
there was pasture for our horses the shower mentioned as having
fallen a fortnight ago only reached about half-way to guasco we had 
therefore in the first part of our journey a most faint tinge of
green which soon faded quite away even where brightest it was
scarcely sufficient to remind one of the fresh turf and budding flowers
of the spring of other countries while travelling through these
deserts one feels like a prisoner shut up in a gloomy court who longs
to see something green and to smell a moist atmosphere 

june rd yerba buena to carizal during the first part of the day we
crossed a mountainous rocky desert and afterwards a long deep sandy
plain strewed with broken sea-shells there was very little water and
that little saline the whole country from the coast to the
cordillera is an uninhabited desert i saw traces only of one living
animal in abundance namely the shells of a bulimus which were
collected together in extraordinary numbers on the driest spots in
the spring one humble little plant sends out a few leaves and on these
the snails feed as they are seen only very early in the morning when
the ground is slightly damp with dew the guascos believe that they are
bred from it i have observed in other places that extremely dry and
sterile districts where the soil is calcareous are extraordinarily
favourable to land-shells at carizal there were a few cottages some
brackish water and a trace of cultivation but it was with difficulty
that we purchased a little corn and straw for our horses 

th carizal to sauce we continued to ride over desert plains 
tenanted by large herds of guanaco we crossed also the valley of
chaneral which although the most fertile one between guasco and
coquimbo is very narrow and produces so little pasture that we could
not purchase any for our horses at sauce we found a very civil old
gentleman superintendent of a copper-smelting furnace as an especial
favour he allowed me to purchase at a high price an armful of dirty
straw which was all the poor horses had for supper after their long
day s journey few smelting-furnaces are now at work in any part of
chile it is found more profitable on account of the extreme scarcity
of firewood and from the chilian method of reduction being so
unskilful to ship the ore for swansea the next day we crossed some
mountains to freyrina in the valley of guasco during each day s ride
further northward the vegetation became more and more scanty even the
great chandelier-like cactus was here replaced by a different and much
smaller species during the winter months both in northern chile and
in peru a uniform bank of clouds hangs at no great height over the
pacific from the mountains we had a very striking view of this white
and brilliant aerial-field which sent arms up the valleys leaving
islands and promontories in the same manner as the sea does in the
chonos archipelago and in tierra del fuego 

we stayed two days at freyrina in the valley of guasco there are four
small towns at the mouth there is the port a spot entirely desert 
and without any water in the immediate neighbourhood five leagues
higher up stands freyrina a long straggling village with decent
whitewashed houses again ten leagues further up ballenar is situated 
and above this guasco alto a horticultural village famous for its
dried fruit on a clear day the view up the valley is very fine the
straight opening terminates in the far-distant snowy cordillera on
each side an infinity of crossing-lines are blended together in a
beautiful haze the foreground is singular from the number of parallel
and step-formed terraces and the included strip of green valley with
its willow-bushes is contrasted on both hands with the naked hills 
that the surrounding country was most barren will be readily believed 
when it is known that a shower of rain had not fallen during the last
thirteen months the inhabitants heard with the greatest envy of the
rain at coquimbo from the appearance of the sky they had hopes of
equally good fortune which a fortnight afterwards were realized i
was at copiapo at the time and there the people with equal envy 
talked of the abundant rain at guasco after two or three very dry
years perhaps with not more than one shower during the whole time a
rainy year generally follows and this does more harm than even the
drought the rivers swell and cover with gravel and sand the narrow
strips of ground which alone are fit for cultivation the floods also
injure the irrigating ditches great devastation had thus been caused
three years ago 

june th we rode on to ballenar which takes its name from ballenagh
in ireland the birthplace of the family of o higgins who under the
spanish government were presidents and generals in chile as the rocky
mountains on each hand were concealed by clouds the terrace-like
plains gave to the valley an appearance like that of santa cruz in
patagonia after spending one day at ballenar i set out on the th 
for the upper part of the valley of copiapo we rode all day over an
uninteresting country i am tired of repeating the epithets barren and
sterile these words however as commonly used are comparative i
have always applied them to the plains of patagonia which can boast of
spiny bushes and some tufts of grass and this is absolute fertility 
as compared with northern chile here again there are not many spaces
of two hundred yards square where some little bush cactus or lichen 
may not be discovered by careful examination and in the soil seeds lie
dormant ready to spring up during the first rainy winter in peru real
deserts occur over wide tracts of country in the evening we arrived at
a valley in which the bed of the streamlet was damp following it up 
we came to tolerably good water during the night the stream from not
being evaporated and absorbed so quickly flows a league lower down
than during the day sticks were plentiful for firewood so that it
was a good place to bivouac for us but for the poor animals there was
not a mouthful to eat 

june th we rode without stopping for twelve hours till we reached
an old smelting-furnace where there was water and firewood but our
horses again had nothing to eat being shut up in an old courtyard the
line of road was hilly and the distant views interesting from the
varied colours of the bare mountains it was almost a pity to see the
sun shining constantly over so useless a country such splendid weather
ought to have brightened fields and pretty gardens the next day we
reached the valley of copiapo i was heartily glad of it for the whole
journey was a continued source of anxiety it was most disagreeable to
hear whilst eating our own suppers our horses gnawing the posts to
which they were tied and to have no means of relieving their hunger 
to all appearance however the animals were quite fresh and no one
could have told that they had eaten nothing for the last fifty-five
hours 

i had a letter of introduction to mr bingley who received me very
kindly at the hacienda of potrero seco this estate is between twenty
and thirty miles long but very narrow being generally only two fields
wide one on each side the river in some parts the estate is of no
width that is to say the land cannot be irrigated and therefore is
valueless like the surrounding rocky desert the small quantity of
cultivated land in the whole line of valley does not so much depend on
inequalities of level and consequent unfitness for irrigation as on
the small supply of water the river this year was remarkably full 
here high up the valley it reached to the horse s belly and was
about fifteen yards wide and rapid lower down it becomes smaller and
smaller and is generally quite lost as happened during one period of
thirty years so that not a drop entered the sea the inhabitants
watch a storm over the cordillera with great interest as one good fall
of snow provides them with water for the ensuing year this is of
infinitely more consequence than rain in the lower country rain as
often as it falls which is about once in every two or three years is
a great advantage because the cattle and mules can for some time
afterwards find a little pasture in the mountains but without snow on
the andes desolation extends throughout the valley it is on record
that three times nearly all the inhabitants have been obliged to
emigrate to the south this year there was plenty of water and every
man irrigated his ground as much as he chose but it has frequently
been necessary to post soldiers at the sluices to see that each estate
took only its proper allowance during so many hours in the week the
valley is said to contain souls but its produce is sufficient
only for three months in the year the rest of the supply being drawn
from valparaiso and the south before the discovery of the famous
silver-mines of chanuncillo copiapo was in a rapid state of decay but
now it is in a very thriving condition and the town which was
completely overthrown by an earthquake has been rebuilt 

the valley of copiapo forming a mere ribbon of green in a desert runs
in a very southerly direction so that it is of considerable length to
its source in the cordillera the valleys of guasco and copiapo may
both be considered as long narrow islands separated from the rest of
chile by deserts of rock instead of by salt water northward of these 
there is one other very miserable valley called paposo which contains
about two hundred souls and then there extends the real desert of
atacama a barrier far worse than the most turbulent ocean after
staying a few days at potrero seco i proceeded up the valley to the
house of don benito cruz to whom i had a letter of introduction i
found him most hospitable indeed it is impossible to bear too strong
testimony to the kindness with which travellers are received in almost
every part of south america the next day i hired some mules to take
me by the ravine of jolquera into the central cordillera on the
second night the weather seemed to foretell a storm of snow or rain 
and whilst lying in our beds we felt a trifling shock of an earthquake 

the connection between earthquakes and the weather has been often
disputed it appears to me to be a point of great interest which is
little understood humboldt has remarked in one part of the personal
narrative that it would be difficult for any person who had long
resided in new andalusia or in lower peru to deny that there exists
some connection between these phenomena in another part however he
seems to think the connection fanciful at guayaquil it is said that a
heavy shower in the dry season is invariably followed by an earthquake 
in northern chile from the extreme infrequency of rain or even of
weather foreboding rain the probability of accidental coincidences
becomes very small yet the inhabitants are here most firmly convinced
of some connection between the state of the atmosphere and of the
trembling of the ground i was much struck by this when mentioning to
some people at copiapo that there had been a sharp shock at coquimbo 
they immediately cried out how fortunate there will be plenty of
pasture there this year to their minds an earthquake foretold rain as
surely as rain foretold abundant pasture certainly it did so happen
that on the very day of the earthquake that shower of rain fell which
i have described as in ten days time producing a thin sprinkling of
grass at other times rain has followed earthquakes at a period of the
year when it is a far greater prodigy than the earthquake itself this
happened after the shock of november and again in at
valparaiso also after that of september at tacna a person must
be somewhat habituated to the climate of these countries to perceive
the extreme improbability of rain falling at such seasons except as a
consequence of some law quite unconnected with the ordinary course of
the weather in the cases of great volcanic eruptions as that of
coseguina where torrents of rain fell at a time of the year most
unusual for it and almost unprecedented in central america it is
not difficult to understand that the volumes of vapour and clouds of
ashes might have disturbed the atmospheric equilibrium humboldt
extends this view to the case of earthquakes unaccompanied by
eruptions but i can hardly conceive it possible that the small
quantity of aeriform fluids which then escape from the fissured ground 
can produce such remarkable effects there appears much probability in
the view first proposed by mr p scrope that when the barometer is
low and when rain might naturally be expected to fall the diminished
pressure of the atmosphere over a wide extent of country might well
determine the precise day on which the earth already stretched to the
utmost by the subterranean forces should yield crack and
consequently tremble it is however doubtful how far this idea will
explain the circumstances of torrents of rain falling in the dry season
during several days after an earthquake unaccompanied by an eruption 
such cases seem to bespeak some more intimate connection between the
atmospheric and subterranean regions 

finding little of interest in this part of the ravine we retraced our
steps to the house of don benito where i stayed two days collecting
fossil shells and wood great prostrate silicified trunks of trees 
embedded in a conglomerate were extraordinarily numerous i measured
one which was fifteen feet in circumference how surprising it is that
every atom of the woody matter in this great cylinder should have been
removed and replaced by silex so perfectly that each vessel and pore
is preserved these trees flourished at about the period of our lower
chalk they all belonged to the fir-tribe it was amusing to hear the
inhabitants discussing the nature of the fossil shells which i
collected almost in the same terms as were used a century ago in
europe namely whether or not they had been thus born by nature my
geological examination of the country generally created a good deal of
surprise amongst the chilenos it was long before they could be
convinced that i was not hunting for mines this was sometimes
troublesome i found the most ready way of explaining my employment 
was to ask them how it was that they themselves were not curious
concerning earthquakes and volcanos why some springs were hot and
others cold why there were mountains in chile and not a hill in la
plata these bare questions at once satisfied and silenced the greater
number some however like a few in england who are a century
behindhand thought that all such inquiries were useless and impious 
and that it was quite sufficient that god had thus made the mountains 

an order had recently been issued that all stray dogs should be killed 
and we saw many lying dead on the road a great number had lately gone
mad and several men had been bitten and had died in consequence on
several occasions hydrophobia has prevailed in this valley it is
remarkable thus to find so strange and dreadful a disease appearing
time after time in the same isolated spot it has been remarked that
certain villages in england are in like manner much more subject to
this visitation than others dr unanue states that hydrophobia was
first known in south america in this statement is corroborated by
azara and ulloa having never heard of it in their time dr unanue
says that it broke out in central america and slowly travelled
southward it reached arequipa in and it is said that some men
there who had not been bitten were affected as were some negroes 
who had eaten a bullock which had died of hydrophobia at ica
forty-two people thus miserably perished the disease came on between
twelve and ninety days after the bite and in those cases where it did
come on death ensued invariably within five days after a long
interval ensued without any cases on inquiry i did not hear of
hydrophobia in van diemen s land or in australia and burchell says 
that during the five years he was at the cape of good hope he never
heard of an instance of it webster asserts that at the azores
hydrophobia has never occurred and the same assertion has been made
with respect to mauritius and st helena in so strange a disease
some information might possibly be gained by considering the
circumstances under which it originates in distant climates for it is
improbable that a dog already bitten should have been brought to these
distant countries 

at night a stranger arrived at the house of don benito and asked
permission to sleep there he said he had been wandering about the
mountains for seventeen days having lost his way he started from
guasco and being accustomed to travelling in the cordillera did not
expect any difficulty in following the track to copiapo but he soon
became involved in a labyrinth of mountains whence he could not
escape some of his mules had fallen over precipices and he had been
in great distress his chief difficulty arose from not knowing where
to find water in the lower country so that he was obliged to keep
bordering the central ranges 

we returned down the valley and on the nd reached the town of
copiapo the lower part of the valley is broad forming a fine plain
like that of quillota the town covers a considerable space of ground 
each house possessing a garden but it is an uncomfortable place and
the dwellings are poorly furnished every one seems bent on the one
object of making money and then migrating as quickly as possible all
the inhabitants are more or less directly concerned with mines and
mines and ores are the sole subjects of conversation necessaries of
all sorts are extremely dear as the distance from the town to the port
is eighteen leagues and the land carriage very expensive a fowl
costs five or six shillings meat is nearly as dear as in england 
firewood or rather sticks are brought on donkeys from a distance of
two and three days journey within the cordillera and pasturage for
animals is a shilling a day all this for south america is wonderfully
exorbitant 


june th i hired a guide and eight mules to take me into the
cordillera by a different line from my last excursion as the country
was utterly desert we took a cargo and a half of barley mixed with
chopped straw about two leagues above the town a broad valley called
the despoblado or uninhabited branches off from that one by which
we had arrived although a valley of the grandest dimensions and
leading to a pass across the cordillera yet it is completely dry 
excepting perhaps for a few days during some very rainy winter the
sides of the crumbling mountains were furrowed by scarcely any ravines 
and the bottom of the main valley filled with shingle was smooth and
nearly level no considerable torrent could ever have flowed down this
bed of shingle for if it had a great cliff-bounded channel as in all
the southern valleys would assuredly have been formed i feel little
doubt that this valley as well as those mentioned by travellers in
peru were left in the state we now see them by the waves of the sea 
as the land slowly rose i observed in one place where the despoblado
was joined by a ravine which in almost any other chain would have been
called a grand valley that its bed though composed merely of sand
and gravel was higher than that of its tributary a mere rivulet of
water in the course of an hour would have cut a channel for itself 
but it was evident that ages had passed away and no such rivulet had
drained this great tributary it was curious to behold the machinery 
if such a term may be used for the drainage all with the last
trifling exception perfect yet without any signs of action every
one must have remarked how mud-banks left by the retiring tide 
imitate in miniature a country with hill and dale and here we have the
original model in rock formed as the continent rose during the secular
retirement of the ocean instead of during the ebbing and flowing of
the tides if a shower of rain falls on the mud-bank when left dry 
it deepens the already-formed shallow lines of excavation and so it is
with the rain of successive centuries on the bank of rock and soil 
which we call a continent 

we rode on after it was dark till we reached a side ravine with a
small well called agua amarga the water deserved its name for
besides being saline it was most offensively putrid and bitter so that
we could not force ourselves to drink either tea or mate i suppose
the distance from the river of copiapo to this spot was at least
twenty-five or thirty english miles in the whole space there was not a
single drop of water the country deserving the name of desert in the
strictest sense yet about half way we passed some old indian ruins
near punta gorda i noticed also in front of some of the valleys which
branch off from the despoblado two piles of stones placed a little way
apart and directed so as to point up the mouths of these small
valleys my companions knew nothing about them and only answered my
queries by their imperturbable quien sabe 

i observed indian ruins in several parts of the cordillera the most
perfect which i saw were the ruinas de tambillos in the uspallata
pass small square rooms were there huddled together in separate
groups some of the doorways were yet standing they were formed by a
cross slab of stone only about three feet high ulloa has remarked on
the lowness of the doors in the ancient peruvian dwellings these
houses when perfect must have been capable of containing a
considerable number of persons tradition says that they were used as
halting-places for the incas when they crossed the mountains traces
of indian habitations have been discovered in many other parts where
it does not appear probable that they were used as mere resting-places 
but yet where the land is as utterly unfit for any kind of cultivation 
as it is near the tambillos or at the incas bridge or in the portillo
pass at all which places i saw ruins in the ravine of jajuel near
aconcagua where there is no pass i heard of remains of houses
situated at a great height where it is extremely cold and sterile at
first i imagined that these buildings had been places of refuge built
by the indians on the first arrival of the spaniards but i have since
been inclined to speculate on the probability of a small change of
climate 

in this northern part of chile within the cordillera old indian
houses are said to be especially numerous by digging amongst the
ruins bits of woollen articles instruments of precious metals and
heads of indian corn are not unfrequently discovered an arrow-head
made of agate and of precisely the same form with those now used in
tierra del fuego was given me i am aware that the peruvian indians
now frequently inhabit most lofty and bleak situations but at copiapo
i was assured by men who had spent their lives in travelling through
the andes that there were very many muchisimas buildings at heights
so great as almost to border upon the perpetual snow and in parts
where there exist no passes and where the land produces absolutely
nothing and what is still more extraordinary where there is no water 
nevertheless it is the opinion of the people of the country although
they are much puzzled by the circumstance that from the appearance
of the houses the indians must have used them as places of residence 
in this valley at punta gorda the remains consisted of seven or eight
square little rooms which were of a similar form with those at
tambillos but built chiefly of mud which the present inhabitants
cannot either here or according to ulloa in peru imitate in
durability they were situated in the most conspicuous and defenceless
position at the bottom of the flat broad valley there was no water
nearer than three or four leagues and that only in very small
quantity and bad the soil was absolutely sterile i looked in vain
even for a lichen adhering to the rocks at the present day with the
advantage of beasts of burden a mine unless it were very rich could
scarcely be worked here with profit yet the indians formerly chose it
as a place of residence if at the present time two or three showers
of rain were to fall annually instead of one as now is the case
during as many years a small rill of water would probably be formed in
this great valley and then by irrigation which was formerly so well
understood by the indians the soil would easily be rendered
sufficiently productive to support a few families 

i have convincing proofs that this part of the continent of south
america has been elevated near the coast at least from to and
in some parts from to feet since the epoch of existing
shells and further inland the rise possibly may have been greater as
the peculiarly arid character of the climate is evidently a consequence
of the height of the cordillera we may feel almost sure that before
the later elevations the atmosphere could not have been so completely
drained of its moisture as it now is and as the rise has been gradual 
so would have been the change in climate on this notion of a change
of climate since the buildings were inhabited the ruins must be of
extreme antiquity but i do not think their preservation under the
chilian climate any great difficulty we must also admit on this
notion and this perhaps is a greater difficulty that man has
inhabited south america for an immensely long period inasmuch as any
change of climate effected by the elevation of the land must have been
extremely gradual at valparaiso within the last years the rise
has been somewhat less than feet at lima a sea-beach has certainly
been upheaved from to feet within the indo-human period but
such small elevations could have had little power in deflecting the
moisture-bringing atmospheric currents dr lund however found human
skeletons in the caves of brazil the appearance of which induced him
to believe that the indian race has existed during a vast lapse of time
in south america 

when at lima i conversed on these subjects with mr gill a civil
engineer who had seen much of the interior country he told me that a
conjecture of a change of climate had sometimes crossed his mind but
that he thought that the greater portion of land now incapable of
cultivation but covered with indian ruins had been reduced to this
state by the water-conduits which the indians formerly constructed on
so wonderful a scale having been injured by neglect and by
subterranean movements i may here mention that the peruvians
actually carried their irrigating streams in tunnels through hills of
solid rock mr gill told me he had been employed professionally to
examine one he found the passage low narrow crooked and not of
uniform breadth but of very considerable length is it not most
wonderful that men should have attempted such operations without the
use of iron or gunpowder mr gill also mentioned to me a most
interesting and as far as i am aware quite unparalleled case of a
subterranean disturbance having changed the drainage of a country 
travelling from casma to huaraz not very far distant from lima he
found a plain covered with ruins and marks of ancient cultivation but
now quite barren near it was the dry course of a considerable river 
whence the water for irrigation had formerly been conducted there was
nothing in the appearance of the water-course to indicate that the
river had not flowed there a few years previously in some parts beds
of sand and gravel were spread out in others the solid rock had been
worn into a broad channel which in one spot was about yards in
breadth and feet deep it is self-evident that a person following up
the course of a stream will always ascend at a greater or less
inclination mr gill therefore was much astonished when walking up
the bed of this ancient river to find himself suddenly going down
hill he imagined that the downward slope had a fall of about or 
feet perpendicular we here have unequivocal evidence that a ridge had
been uplifted right across the old bed of a stream from the moment
the river-course was thus arched the water must necessarily have been
thrown back and a new channel formed from that moment also the
neighbouring plain must have lost its fertilizing stream and become a
desert 

june th we set out early in the morning and by midday reached the
ravine of paypote where there is a tiny rill of water with a little
vegetation and even a few algarroba trees a kind of mimosa from
having firewood a smelting-furnace had formerly been built here we
found a solitary man in charge of it whose sole employment was hunting
guanacos at night it froze sharply but having plenty of wood for our
fire we kept ourselves warm 

th we continued gradually ascending and the valley now changed
into a ravine during the day we saw several guanacos and the track
of the closely-allied species the vicuna this latter animal is
pre-eminently alpine in its habits it seldom descends much below the
limit of perpetual snow and therefore haunts even a more lofty and
sterile situation than the guanaco the only other animal which we saw
in any number was a small fox i suppose this animal preys on the mice
and other small rodents which as long as there is the least
vegetation subsist in considerable numbers in very desert places in
patagonia even on the borders of the salinas where a drop of fresh
water can never be found excepting dew these little animals swarm 
next to lizards mice appear to be able to support existence on the
smallest and driest portions of the earth even on islets in the midst
of great oceans 

the scene on all sides showed desolation brightened and made palpable
by a clear unclouded sky for a time such scenery is sublime but
this feeling cannot last and then it becomes uninteresting we
bivouacked at the foot of the primera linea or the first line of the
partition of waters the streams however on the east side do not flow
to the atlantic but into an elevated district in the middle of which
there is a large saline or salt lake thus forming a little caspian
sea at the height perhaps of ten thousand feet where we slept 
there were some considerable patches of snow but they do not remain
throughout the year the winds in these lofty regions obey very
regular laws ivery day a fresh breeze blows up the valley and at
night an hour or two after sunset the air from the cold regions above
descends as through a funnel this night it blew a gale of wind and
the temperature must have been considerably below the freezing-point 
for water in a vessel soon became a block of ice no clothes seemed to
oppose any obstacle to the air i suffered very much from the cold so
that i could not sleep and in the morning rose with my body quite dull
and benumbed 

in the cordillera further southward people lose their lives from
snow-storms here it sometimes happens from another cause my guide 
when a boy of fourteen years old was passing the cordillera with a
party in the month of may and while in the central parts a furious
gale of wind arose so that the men could hardly cling on their mules 
and stones were flying along the ground the day was cloudless and
not a speck of snow fell but the temperature was low it is probable
that the thermometer could not have stood very many degrees below the
freezing-point but the effect on their bodies ill protected by
clothing must have been in proportion to the rapidity of the current
of cold air the gale lasted for more than a day the men began to
lose their strength and the mules would not move onwards my guide s
brother tried to return but he perished and his body was found two
years afterwards lying by the side of his mule near the road with the
bridle still in his hand two other men in the party lost their
fingers and toes and out of two hundred mules and thirty cows only
fourteen mules escaped alive many years ago the whole of a large
party are supposed to have perished from a similar cause but their
bodies to this day have never been discovered the union of a
cloudless sky low temperature and a furious gale of wind must be i
should think in all parts of the world an unusual occurrence 

june th we gladly travelled down the valley to our former night s
lodging and thence to near the agua amarga on july st we reached the
valley of copiapo the smell of the fresh clover was quite delightful 
after the scentless air of the dry sterile despoblado whilst staying
in the town i heard an account from several of the inhabitants of a
hill in the neighbourhood which they called el bramador the roarer
or bellower i did not at the time pay sufficient attention to the
account but as far as i understood the hill was covered by sand and
the noise was produced only when people by ascending it put the sand
in motion the same circumstances are described in detail on the
authority of seetzen and ehrenberg as the cause of the sounds
which have been heard by many travellers on mount sinai near the red
sea one person with whom i conversed had himself heard the noise he
described it as very surprising and he distinctly stated that 
although he could not understand how it was caused yet it was
necessary to set the sand rolling down the acclivity a horse walking
over dry coarse sand causes a peculiar chirping noise from the
friction of the particles a circumstance which i several times noticed
on the coast of brazil 

three days afterwards i heard of the beagle s arrival at the port 
distant eighteen leagues from the town there is very little land
cultivated down the valley its wide expanse supports a wretched wiry
grass which even the donkeys can hardly eat this poorness of the
vegetation is owing to the quantity of saline matter with which the
soil is impregnated the port consists of an assemblage of miserable
little hovels situated at the foot of a sterile plain at present as
the river contains water enough to reach the sea the inhabitants enjoy
the advantage of having fresh water within a mile and a half on the
beach there were large piles of merchandise and the little place had
an air of activity in the evening i gave my adios with a hearty
good-will to my companion mariano gonzales with whom i had ridden so
many leagues in chile the next morning the beagle sailed for iquique 

july th we anchored in the port of iquique in lat degs 
on the coast of peru the town contains about a thousand inhabitants 
and stands on a little plain of sand at the foot of a great wall of
rock feet in height here forming the coast the whole is
utterly desert a light shower of rain falls only once in very many
years and the ravines consequently are filled with detritus and the
mountain-sides covered by piles of fine white sand even to a height of
a thousand feet during this season of the year a heavy bank of
clouds stretched over the ocean seldom rises above the wall of rocks
on the coast the aspect of the place was most gloomy the little
port with its few vessels and small group of wretched houses seemed
overwhelmed and out of all proportion with the rest of the scene 

the inhabitants live like persons on board a ship every necessary
comes from a distance water is brought in boats from pisagua about
forty miles northward and is sold at the rate of nine reals s d 
an eighteen-gallon cask i bought a wine-bottle full for threepence in
like manner firewood and of course every article of food is imported 
very few animals can be maintained in such a place on the ensuing
morning i hired with difficulty at the price of four pounds sterling 
two mules and a guide to take me to the nitrate of soda works these
are at present the support of iquique this salt was first exported in
 in one year an amount in value of one hundred thousand pounds
sterling was sent to france and england it is principally used as a
manure and in the manufacture of nitric acid owing to its deliquescent
property it will not serve for gunpowder formerly there were two
exceedingly rich silver-mines in this neighbourhood but their produce
is now very small 

our arrival in the offing caused some little apprehension peru was in
a state of anarchy and each party having demanded a contribution the
poor town of iquique was in tribulation thinking the evil hour was
come the people had also their domestic troubles a short time
before three french carpenters had broken open during the same night 
the two churches and stolen all the plate one of the robbers 
however subsequently confessed and the plate was recovered the
convicts were sent to arequipa which though the capital of this
province is two hundred leagues distant the government there thought
it a pity to punish such useful workmen who could make all sorts of
furniture and accordingly liberated them things being in this state 
the churches were again broken open but this time the plate was not
recovered the inhabitants became dreadfully enraged and declaring
that none but heretics would thus eat god almighty proceeded to
torture some englishmen with the intention of afterwards shooting
them at last the authorities interfered and peace was established 


th in the morning i started for the saltpetre-works a distance of
fourteen leagues having ascended the steep coast-mountains by a
zigzag sandy track we soon came in view of the mines of guantajaya and
st rosa these two small villages are placed at the very mouths of
the mines and being perched up on hills they had a still more
unnatural and desolate appearance than the town of iquique we did not
reach the saltpetre-works till after sunset having ridden all day
across an undulating country a complete and utter desert the road
was strewed with the bones and dried skins of many beasts of burden
which had perished on it from fatigue excepting the vultur aura 
which preys on the carcasses i saw neither bird quadruped reptile 
nor insect on the coast-mountains at the height of about feet
where during this season the clouds generally hang a very few cacti
were growing in the clefts of rock and the loose sand was strewed over
with a lichen which lies on the surface quite unattached this plant
belongs to the genus cladonia and somewhat resembles the reindeer
lichen in some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the sand 
as seen from a distance of a pale yellowish colour further inland 
during the whole ride of fourteen leagues i saw only one other
vegetable production and that was a most minute yellow lichen growing
on the bones of the dead mules this was the first true desert which i
had seen the effect on me was not impressive but i believe this was
owing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes as i
rode northward from valparaiso through coquimbo to copiapo the
appearance of the country was remarkable from being covered by a thick
crust of common salt and of a stratified saliferous alluvium which
seems to have been deposited as the land slowly rose above the level of
the sea the salt is white very hard and compact it occurs in water
worn nodules projecting from the agglutinated sand and is associated
with much gypsum the appearance of this superficial mass very closely
resembled that of a country after snow before the last dirty patches
are thawed the existence of this crust of a soluble substance over
the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily dry the
climate must have been for a long period 

at night i slept at the house of the owner of one of the saltpetre
mines the country is here as unproductive as near the coast but
water having rather a bitter and brackish taste can be procured by
digging wells the well at this house was thirty-six yards deep as
scarcely any rain falls it is evident the water is not thus derived 
indeed if it were it could not fail to be as salt as brine for the
whole surrounding country is incrusted with various saline substances 
we must therefore conclude that it percolates under ground from the
cordillera though distant many leagues in that direction there are a
few small villages where the inhabitants having more water are
enabled to irrigate a little land and raise hay on which the mules
and asses employed in carrying the saltpetre are fed the nitrate of
soda was now selling at the ship s side at fourteen shillings per
hundred pounds the chief expense is its transport to the sea-coast 
the mine consists of a hard stratum between two and three feet thick 
of the nitrate mingled with a little of the sulphate of soda and a good
deal of common salt it lies close beneath the surface and follows
for a length of one hundred and fifty miles the margin of a grand basin
or plain this from its outline manifestly must once have been a
lake or more probably an inland arm of the sea as may be inferred
from the presence of iodic salts in the saline stratum the surface of
the plain is feet above the pacific 


th we anchored in the bay of callao the seaport of lima the
capital of peru we stayed here six weeks but from the troubled state
of public affairs i saw very little of the country during our whole
visit the climate was far from being so delightful as it is generally
represented a dull heavy bank of clouds constantly hung over the
land so that during the first sixteen days i had only one view of the
cordillera behind lima these mountains seen in stages one above the
other through openings in the clouds had a very grand appearance it
is almost become a proverb that rain never falls in the lower part of
peru yet this can hardly be considered correct for during almost
every day of our visit there was a thick drizzling mist which was
sufficient to make the streets muddy and one s clothes damp this the
people are pleased to call peruvian dew that much rain does not fall
is very certain for the houses are covered only with flat roofs made
of hardened mud and on the mole shiploads of wheat were piled up 
being thus left for weeks together without any shelter 

i cannot say i liked the very little i saw of peru in summer however 
it is said that the climate is much pleasanter in all seasons both
inhabitants and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague this
disease is common on the whole coast of peru but is unknown in the
interior the attacks of illness which arise from miasma never fail to
appear most mysterious so difficult is it to judge from the aspect of
a country whether or not it is healthy that if a person had been told
to choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for
health very probably he would have named this coast the plain round
the outskirts of callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass and
in some parts there are a few stagnant though very small pools of
water the miasma in all probability arises from these for the town
of arica was similarly circumstanced and its healthiness was much
improved by the drainage of some little pools miasma is not always
produced by a luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate for many
parts of brazil even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation 
are much more healthy than this sterile coast of peru the densest
forests in a temperate climate as in chiloe do not seem in the
slightest degree to affect the healthy condition of the atmosphere 

the island of st jago at the cape de verds offers another strongly
marked instance of a country which any one would have expected to find
most healthy being very much the contrary i have described the bare
and open plains as supporting during a few weeks after the rainy
season a thin vegetation which directly withers away and dries up at
this period the air appears to become quite poisonous both natives and
foreigners often being affected with violent fevers on the other hand 
the galapagos archipelago in the pacific with a similar soil and
periodically subject to the same process of vegetation is perfectly
healthy humboldt has observed that under the torrid zone the
smallest marshes are the most dangerous being surrounded as at vera
cruz and carthagena with an arid and sandy soil which raises the
temperature of the ambient air on the coast of peru however the
temperature is not hot to any excessive degree and perhaps in
consequence the intermittent fevers are not of the most malignant
order in all unhealthy countries the greatest risk is run by sleeping
on shore is this owing to the state of the body during sleep or to a
greater abundance of miasma at such times it appears certain that
those who stay on board a vessel though anchored at only a short
distance from the coast generally suffer less than those actually on
shore on the other hand i have heard of one remarkable case where a
fever broke out among the crew of a man-of-war some hundred miles off
the coast of africa and at the same time one of those fearful periods
 of death commenced at sierra leone 

no state in south america since the declaration of independence has
suffered more from anarchy than peru at the time of our visit there
were four chiefs in arms contending for supremacy in the government if
one succeeded in becoming for a time very powerful the others
coalesced against him but no sooner were they victorious than they
were again hostile to each other the other day at the anniversary of
the independence high mass was performed the president partaking of
the sacrament during the te deum laudamus instead of each regiment
displaying the peruvian flag a black one with death s head was
unfurled imagine a government under which such a scene could be
ordered on such an occasion to be typical of their determination of
fighting to death this state of affairs happened at a time very
unfortunately for me as i was precluded from taking any excursions
much beyond the limits of the town the barren island of st lorenzo 
which forms the harbour was nearly the only place where one could walk
securely the upper part which is upwards of feet in height 
during this season of the year winter comes within the lower limit
of the clouds and in consequence an abundant cryptogamic vegetation 
and a few flowers cover the summit on the hills near lima at a
height but little greater the ground is carpeted with moss and beds
of beautiful yellow lilies called amancaes this indicates a very
much greater degree of humidity than at a corresponding height at
iquique proceeding northward of lima the climate becomes damper till
on the banks of the guayaquil nearly under the equator we find the
most luxuriant forests the change however from the sterile coast of
peru to that fertile land is described as taking place rather abruptly
in the latitude of cape blanco two degrees south of guayaquil 

callao is a filthy ill-built small seaport the inhabitants both
here and at lima present every imaginable shade of mixture between
european negro and indian blood they appear a depraved drunken set
of people the atmosphere is loaded with foul smells and that
peculiar one which may be perceived in almost every town within the
tropics was here very strong the fortress which withstood lord
cochrane s long siege has an imposing appearance but the president 
during our stay sold the brass guns and proceeded to dismantle parts
of it the reason assigned was that he had not an officer to whom he
could trust so important a charge he himself had good reason for
thinking so as he had obtained the presidentship by rebelling while in
charge of this same fortress after we left south america he paid the
penalty in the usual manner by being conquered taken prisoner and
shot 

lima stands on a plain in a valley formed during the gradual retreat
of the sea it is seven miles from callao and is elevated feet
above it but from the slope being very gradual the road appears
absolutely level so that when at lima it is difficult to believe one
has ascended even one hundred feet humboldt has remarked on this
singularly deceptive case steep barren hills rise like islands from
the plain which is divided by straight mud-walls into large green
fields in these scarcely a tree grows excepting a few willows and an
occasional clump of bananas and of oranges the city of lima is now in
a wretched state of decay the streets are nearly unpaved and heaps of
filth are piled up in all directions where the black gallinazos tame
as poultry pick up bits of carrion the houses have generally an
upper story built on account of the earthquakes of plastered woodwork
but some of the old ones which are now used by several families are
immensely large and would rival in suites of apartments the most
magnificent in any place lima the city of the kings must formerly
have been a splendid town the extraordinary number of churches gives
it even at the present day a peculiar and striking character 
especially when viewed from a short distance 

one day i went out with some merchants to hunt in the immediate
vicinity of the city our sport was very poor but i had an
opportunity of seeing the ruins of one of the ancient indian villages 
with its mound like a natural hill in the centre the remains of
houses enclosures irrigating streams and burial mounds scattered
over this plain cannot fail to give one a high idea of the condition
and number of the ancient population when their earthenware woollen
clothes utensils of elegant forms cut out of the hardest rocks tools
of copper ornaments of precious stones palaces and hydraulic works 
are considered it is impossible not to respect the considerable
advance made by them in the arts of civilization the burial mounds 
called huacas are really stupendous although in some places they
appear to be natural hills incased and modelled 

there is also another and very different class of ruins which
possesses some interest namely those of old callao overwhelmed by
the great earthquake of and its accompanying wave the
destruction must have been more complete even than at talcahuano 
quantities of shingle almost conceal the foundations of the walls and
vast masses of brickwork appear to have been whirled about like pebbles
by the retiring waves it has been stated that the land subsided
during this memorable shock i could not discover any proof of this 
yet it seems far from improbable for the form of the coast must
certainly have undergone some change since the foundation of the old
town as no people in their senses would willingly have chosen for
their building place the narrow spit of shingle on which the ruins now
stand since our voyage m tschudi has come to the conclusion by the
comparison of old and modern maps that the coast both north and south
of lima has certainly subsided 

on the island of san lorenzo there are very satisfactory proofs of
elevation within the recent period this of course is not opposed to
the belief of a small sinking of the ground having subsequently taken
place the side of this island fronting the bay of callao is worn
into three obscure terraces the lower one of which is covered by a bed
a mile in length almost wholly composed of shells of eighteen species 
now living in the adjoining sea the height of this bed is eighty-five
feet many of the shells are deeply corroded and have a much older
and more decayed appearance than those at the height of or feet
on the coast of chile these shells are associated with much common
salt a little sulphate of lime both probably left by the evaporation
of the spray as the land slowly rose together with sulphate of soda
and muriate of lime they rest on fragments of the underlying
sandstone and are covered by a few inches thick of detritus the
shells higher up on this terrace could be traced scaling off in
flakes and falling into an impalpable powder and on an upper terrace 
at the height of feet and likewise at some considerably higher
points i found a layer of saline powder of exactly similar appearance 
and lying in the same relative position i have no doubt that this
upper layer originally existed as a bed of shells like that on the
eighty-five-feet ledge but it does not now contain even a trace of
organic structure the powder has been analyzed for me by mr t 
reeks it consists of sulphates and muriates both of lime and soda 
with very little carbonate of lime it is known that common salt and
carbonate of lime left in a mass for some time together partly
decompose each other though this does not happen with small quantities
in solution as the half-decomposed shells in the lower parts are
associated with much common salt together with some of the saline
substances composing the upper saline layer and as these shells are
corroded and decayed in a remarkable manner i strongly suspect that
this double decomposition has here taken place the resultant salts 
however ought to be carbonate of soda and muriate of lime the latter
is present but not the carbonate of soda hence i am led to imagine
that by some unexplained means the carbonate of soda becomes changed
into the sulphate it is obvious that the saline layer could not have
been preserved in any country in which abundant rain occasionally fell 
on the other hand this very circumstance which at first sight appears
so highly favourable to the long preservation of exposed shells has
probably been the indirect means through the common salt not having
been washed away of their decomposition and early decay 

i was much interested by finding on the terrace at the height of
eighty-five feet embedded amidst the shells and much sea-drifted
rubbish some bits of cotton thread plaited rush and the head of a
stalk of indian corn i compared these relics with similar ones taken
out of the huacas or old peruvian tombs and found them identical in
appearance on the mainland in front of san lorenzo near bellavista 
there is an extensive and level plain about a hundred feet high of
which the lower part is formed of alternating layers of sand and impure
clay together with some gravel and the surface to the depth of from
three to six feet of a reddish loam containing a few scattered
sea-shells and numerous small fragments of coarse red earthenware more
abundant at certain spots than at others at first i was inclined to
believe that this superficial bed from its wide extent and smoothness 
must have been deposited beneath the sea but i afterwards found in one
spot that it lay on an artificial floor of round stones it seems 
therefore most probable that at a period when the land stood at a
lower level there was a plain very similar to that now surrounding
callao which being protected by a shingle beach is raised but very
little above the level of the sea on this plain with its underlying
red-clay beds i imagine that the indians manufactured their earthen
vessels and that during some violent earthquake the sea broke over
the beach and converted the plain into a temporary lake as happened
round callao in and the water would then have deposited
mud containing fragments of pottery from the kilns more abundant at
some spots than at others and shells from the sea this bed with
fossil earthenware stands at about the same height with the shells on
the lower terrace of san lorenzo in which the cotton-thread and other
relics were embedded 

hence we may safely conclude that within the indo-human period there
has been an elevation as before alluded to of more than eighty-five
feet for some little elevation must have been lost by the coast having
subsided since the old maps were engraved at valparaiso although in
the years before our visit the elevation cannot have exceeded
nineteen feet yet subsequently to there has been a rise partly
insensible and partly by a start during the shock of of ten or
eleven feet the antiquity of the indo-human race here judging by the
eighty-five feet rise of the land since the relics were embedded is
the more remarkable as on the coast of patagonia when the land stood
about the same number of feet lower the macrauchenia was a living
beast but as the patagonian coast is some way distant from the
cordillera the rising there may have been slower than here at bahia
blanca the elevation has been only a few feet since the numerous
gigantic quadrupeds were there entombed and according to the
generally received opinion when these extinct animals were living man
did not exist but the rising of that part of the coast of patagonia 
is perhaps no way connected with the cordillera but rather with a line
of old volcanic rocks in banda oriental so that it may have been
infinitely slower than on the shores of peru all these speculations 
however must be vague for who will pretend to say that there may not
have been several periods of subsidence intercalated between the
movements of elevation for we know that along the whole coast of
patagonia there have certainly been many and long pauses in the upward
action of the elevatory forces

burrowing habits herbivorous importance of reptiles in the

islands tameness of the birds fear of man an acquired instinct 


september th this archipelago consists of ten principal islands of
which five exceed the others in size they are situated under the
equator and between five and six hundred miles westward of the coast
of america they are all formed of volcanic rocks a few fragments of
granite curiously glazed and altered by the heat can hardly be
considered as an exception some of the craters surmounting the
larger islands are of immense size and they rise to a height of
between three and four thousand feet their flanks are studded by
innumerable smaller orifices i scarcely hesitate to affirm that
there must be in the whole archipelago at least two thousand craters 
these consist either of lava or scoriae or of finely-stratified 
sandstone-like tuff most of the latter are beautifully symmetrical 
they owe their origin to eruptions of volcanic mud without any lava it
is a remarkable circumstance that every one of the twenty-eight
tuff-craters which were examined had their southern sides either much
lower than the other sides or quite broken down and removed as all
these craters apparently have been formed when standing in the sea and
as the waves from the trade wind and the swell from the open pacific
here unite their forces on the southern coasts of all the islands this
singular uniformity in the broken state of the craters composed of the
soft and yielding tuff is easily explained 

considering that these islands are placed directly under the equator 
the climate is far from being excessively hot this seems chiefly
caused by the singularly low temperature of the surrounding water 
brought here by the great southern


 map 


polar current excepting during one short season very little rain
falls and even then it is irregular but the clouds generally hang
low hence whilst the lower parts of the islands are very sterile 
the upper parts at a height of a thousand feet and upwards possess a
damp climate and a tolerably luxuriant vegetation this is especially
the case on the windward sides of the islands which first receive and
condense the moisture from the atmosphere 

in the morning th we landed on chatham island which like the
others rises with a tame and rounded outline broken here and there by
scattered hillocks the remains of former craters nothing could be
less inviting than the first appearance a broken field of black
basaltic lava thrown into the most rugged waves and crossed by great
fissures is everywhere covered by stunted sun-burnt brushwood which
shows little signs of life the dry and parched surface being heated
by the noon-day sun gave to the air a close and sultry feeling like
that from a stove we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly 
although i diligently tried to collect as many plants as possible i
succeeded in getting very few and such wretched-looking little weeds
would have better become an arctic than an equatorial flora the
brushwood appears from a short distance as leafless as our trees
during winter and it was some time before i discovered that not only
almost every plant was now in full leaf but that the greater number
were in flower the commonest bush is one of the euphorbiaceae an
acacia and a great odd-looking cactus are the only trees which afford
any shade after the season of heavy rains the islands are said to
appear for a short time partially green the volcanic island of
fernando noronha placed in many respects under nearly similar
conditions is the only other country where i have seen a vegetation at
all like this of the galapagos islands 

the beagle sailed round chatham island and anchored in several bays 
one night i slept on shore on a part of the island where black
truncated cones were extraordinarily numerous from one small eminence
i counted sixty of them all surmounted by craters more or less
perfect the greater number consisted merely of a ring of red scoriae
or slags cemented together and their height above the plain of lava
was not more than from fifty to a hundred feet none had been very
lately active the entire surface of this part of the island seems to
have been permeated like a sieve by the subterranean vapours here
and there the lava whilst soft has been blown into great bubbles and
in other parts the tops of caverns similarly formed have fallen in 
leaving circular pits with steep sides from the regular form of the
many craters they gave to the country an artificial appearance which
vividly reminded me of those parts of staffordshire where the great
iron-foundries are most numerous the day was glowing hot and the
scrambling over the rough surface and through the intricate thickets 
was very fatiguing but i was well repaid by the strange cyclopean
scene as i was walking along i met two large tortoises each of which
must have weighed at least two hundred pounds one was eating a piece
of cactus and as i approached it stared at me and slowly walked away 
the other gave a deep hiss and drew in its head these huge reptiles 
surrounded by the black lava the leafless shrubs and large cacti 
seemed to my fancy like some antediluvian animals the few
dull-coloured birds cared no more for me than they did for the great
tortoises 

rd the beagle proceeded to charles island this archipelago has
long been frequented first by the bucaniers and latterly by whalers 
but it is only within the last six years that a small colony has been
established here the inhabitants are between two and three hundred in
number they are nearly all people of colour who have been banished
for political crimes from the republic of the equator of which quito
is the capital the settlement is placed about four and a half miles
inland and at a height probably of a thousand feet in the first part
of the road we passed through leafless thickets as in chatham island 
higher up the woods gradually became greener and as soon as we
crossed the ridge of the island we were cooled by a fine southerly
breeze and our sight refreshed by a green and thriving vegetation in
this upper region coarse grasses and ferns abound but there are no
tree-ferns i saw nowhere any member of the palm family which is the
more singular as miles northward cocos island takes its name from
the number of cocoa-nuts the houses are irregularly scattered over a
flat space of ground which is cultivated with sweet potatoes and
bananas it will not easily be imagined how pleasant the sight of
black mud was to us after having been so long accustomed to the
parched soil of peru and northern chile the inhabitants although
complaining of poverty obtain without much trouble the means of
subsistence in the woods there are many wild pigs and goats but the
staple article of animal food is supplied by the tortoises their
numbers have of course been greatly reduced in this island but the
people yet count on two days hunting giving them food for the rest of
the week it is said that formerly single vessels have taken away as
many as seven hundred and that the ship s company of a frigate some
years since brought down in one day two hundred tortoises to the beach 

september th we doubled the south-west extremity of albemarle
island and the next day were nearly becalmed between it and narborough
island both are covered with immense deluges of black naked lava 
which have flowed either over the rims of the great caldrons like
pitch over the rim of a pot in which it has been boiled or have burst
forth from smaller orifices on the flanks in their descent they have
spread over miles of the sea-coast on both of these islands 
eruptions are known to have taken place and in albemarle we saw a
small jet of smoke curling from the summit of one of the great craters 
in the evening we anchored in bank s cove in albemarle island the
next morning i went out walking to the south of the broken
tuff-crater in which the beagle was anchored there was another
beautifully symmetrical one of an elliptic form its longer axis was a
little less than a mile and its depth about feet at its bottom
there was a shallow lake in the middle of which a tiny crater formed
an islet the day was overpoweringly hot and the lake looked clear
and blue i hurried down the cindery slope and choked with dust 
eagerly tasted the water but to my sorrow i found it salt as brine 

the rocks on the coast abounded with great black lizards between three
and four feet long and on the hills an ugly yellowish-brown species
was equally common we saw many of this latter kind some clumsily
running out of the way and others shuffling into their burrows i
shall presently describe in more detail the habits of both these
reptiles the whole of this northern part of albemarle island is
miserably sterile 

october th we arrived at james island this island as well as
charles island were long since thus named after our kings of the
stuart line mr bynoe myself and our servants were left here for a
week with provisions and a tent whilst the beagle went for water we
found here a party of spaniards who had been sent from charles island
to dry fish and to salt tortoise-meat about six miles inland and at
the height of nearly feet a hovel had been built in which two men
lived who were employed in catching tortoises whilst the others were
fishing on the coast i paid this party two visits and slept there
one night as in the other islands the lower region was covered by
nearly leafless bushes but the trees were here of a larger growth than
elsewhere several being two feet and some even two feet nine inches in
diameter the upper region being kept damp by the clouds supports a
green and flourishing vegetation so damp was the ground that there
were large beds of a coarse cyperus in which great numbers of a very
small water-rail lived and bred while staying in this upper region 
we lived entirely upon tortoise-meat the breast-plate roasted as the
gauchos do carne con cuero with the flesh on it is very good and
the young tortoises make excellent soup but otherwise the meat to my
taste is indifferent 

one day we accompanied a party of the spaniards in their whale-boat to
a salina or lake from which salt is procured after landing we had a
very rough walk over a rugged field of recent lava which has almost
surrounded a tuff-crater at the bottom of which the salt-lake lies 
the water is only three or four inches deep and rests on a layer of
beautifully crystallized white salt the lake is quite circular and
is fringed with a border of bright green succulent plants the almost
precipitous walls of the crater are clothed with wood so that the
scene was altogether both picturesque and curious a few years since 
the sailors belonging to a sealing-vessel murdered their captain in
this quiet spot and we saw his skull lying among the bushes 

during the greater part of our stay of a week the sky was cloudless 
and if the trade-wind failed for an hour the heat became very
oppressive on two days the thermometer within the tent stood for
some hours at degs but in the open air in the wind and sun at
only degs the sand was extremely hot the thermometer placed in
some of a brown colour immediately rose to degs and how much
above that it would have risen i do not know for it was not graduated
any higher the black sand felt much hotter so that even in thick
boots it was quite disagreeable to walk over it 


the natural history of these islands is eminently curious and well
deserves attention most of the organic productions are aboriginal
creations found nowhere else there is even a difference between the
inhabitants of the different islands yet all show a marked
relationship with those of america though separated from that
continent by an open space of ocean between and miles in
width the archipelago is a little world within itself or rather a
satellite attached to america whence it has derived a few stray
colonists and has received the general character of its indigenous
productions considering the small size of the islands we feel the
more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings and at their
confined range seeing every height crowned with its crater and the
boundaries of most of the lava-streams still distinct we are led to
believe that within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was
here spread out hence both in space and time we seem to be brought
somewhat near to that great fact that mystery of mysteries the first
appearance of new beings on this earth 

of terrestrial mammals there is only one which must be considered as
indigenous namely a mouse mus galapagoensis and this is confined 
as far as i could ascertain to chatham island the most easterly
island of the group it belongs as i am informed by mr waterhouse 
to a division of the family of mice characteristic of america at
james island there is a rat sufficiently distinct from the common kind
to have been named and described by mr waterhouse but as it belongs
to the old-world division of the family and as this island has been
frequented by ships for the last hundred and fifty years i can hardly
doubt that this rat is merely a variety produced by the new and
peculiar climate food and soil to which it has been subjected 
although no one has a right to speculate without distinct facts yet
even with respect to the chatham island mouse it should be borne in
mind that it may possibly be an american species imported here for i
have seen in a most unfrequented part of the pampas a native mouse
living in the roof of a newly built hovel and therefore its
transportation in a vessel is not improbable analogous facts have been
observed by dr richardson in north america 

of land-birds i obtained twenty-six kinds all peculiar to the group
and found nowhere else with the exception of one lark-like finch from
north america dolichonyx oryzivorus which ranges on that continent
as far north as degs and generally frequents marshes the other
twenty-five birds consist firstly of a hawk curiously intermediate
in structure between a buzzard and the american group of
carrion-feeding polybori and with these latter birds it agrees most
closely in every habit and even tone of voice secondly there are two
owls representing the short-eared and white barn-owls of europe 
thirdly a wren three tyrant-flycatchers two of them species of
pyrocephalus one or both of which would be ranked by some
ornithologists as only varieties and a dove all analogous to but
distinct from american species fourthly a swallow which though
differing from the progne purpurea of both americas only in being
rather duller colored smaller and slenderer is considered by mr 
gould as specifically distinct fifthly there are three species of
mocking thrush a form highly characteristic of america the remaining
land-birds form a most singular group of finches related to each other
in the structure of their beaks short tails form of body and plumage 
there are thirteen species which mr gould has divided into four
sub-groups all these species are peculiar to this archipelago and so
is the whole group with the exception of one species of the sub-group
cactornis lately brought from bow island in the low archipelago of
cactornis the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers
of the great cactus-trees but all the other species of this group of
finches mingled together in flocks feed on the dry and sterile ground
of the lower districts the males of all or certainly of the greater
number are jet black and the females with perhaps one or two
exceptions are brown the most curious fact is the perfect gradation
in the size of the beaks in the different species of geospiza from one
as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch and if mr 
gould is right in including his sub-group certhidea in the main
group even to that of a warbler the largest beak in the genus
geospiza is shown in fig and the smallest in fig but instead of
there being only one intermediate species with a beak of the size
shown in fig there are no less than six species with insensibly
graduated beaks the beak of the sub-group certhidea is shown in fig 
 the beak of cactornis is


 picture 

 geospiza magnirostris geospiza fortis geospiza parvula 
 certhidea olivasea 


somewhat like that of a starling and that of the fourth sub-group 
camarhynchus is slightly parrot-shaped seeing this gradation and
diversity of structure in one small intimately related group of birds 
one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this
archipelago one species had been taken and modified for different
ends in a like manner it might be fancied that a bird originally a
buzzard had been induced here to undertake the office of the
carrion-feeding polybori of the american continent 

of waders and water-birds i was able to get only eleven kinds and of
these only three including a rail confined to the damp summits of the
islands are new species considering the wandering habits of the
gulls i was surprised to find that the species inhabiting these
islands is peculiar but allied to one from the southern parts of south
america the far greater peculiarity of the land-birds namely 
twenty-five out of twenty-six being new species or at least new
races compared with the waders and web-footed birds is in accordance
with the greater range which these latter orders have in all parts of
the world we shall hereafter see this law of aquatic forms whether
marine or fresh-water being less peculiar at any given point of the
earth s surface than the terrestrial forms of the same classes 
strikingly illustrated in the shells and in a lesser degree in the
insects of this archipelago 

two of the waders are rather smaller than the same species brought from
other places the swallow is also smaller though it is doubtful
whether or not it is distinct from its analogue the two owls the two
tyrant-catchers pyrocephalus and the dove are also smaller than the
analogous but distinct species to which they are most nearly related 
on the other hand the gull is rather larger the two owls the
swallow all three species of mocking-thrush the dove in its separate
colours though not in its whole plumage the totanus and the gull are
likewise duskier coloured than their analogous species and in the case
of the mocking-thrush and totanus than any other species of the two
genera with the exception of a wren with a fine yellow breast and of
a tyrant-flycatcher with a scarlet tuft and breast none of the birds
are brilliantly coloured as might have been expected in an equatorial
district hence it would appear probable that the same causes which
here make the immigrants of some peculiar species smaller make most of
the peculiar galapageian species also smaller as well as very
generally more dusky coloured all the plants have a wretched weedy
appearance and i did not see one beautiful flower the insects 
again are small-sized and dull-coloured and as mr waterhouse
informs me there is nothing in their general appearance which would
have led him to imagine that they had come from under the equator 
the birds plants and insects have a desert character and are not
more brilliantly coloured than those from southern patagonia we may 
therefore conclude that the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical
productions is not related either to the heat or light of those zones 
but to some other cause perhaps to the conditions of existence being
generally favourable to life 


we will now turn to the order of reptiles which gives the most
striking character to the zoology of these islands the species are not
numerous but the numbers of individuals of each species are
extraordinarily great there is one small lizard belonging to a south
american genus and two species and probably more of the
amblyrhynchus a genus confined to the galapagos islands there is one
snake which is numerous it is identical as i am informed by m 
bibron with the psammophis temminckii from chile of sea-turtle i
believe there are more than one species and of tortoises there are as
we shall presently show two or three species or races of toads and
frogs there are none i was surprised at this considering how well
suited for them the temperate and damp upper woods appeared to be it
recalled to my mind the remark made by bory st vincent namely 
that none of this family are found on any of the volcanic islands in
the great oceans as far as i can ascertain from various works this
seems to hold good throughout the pacific and even in the large
islands of the sandwich archipelago mauritius offers an apparent
exception where i saw the rana mascariensis in abundance this frog is
said now to inhabit the seychelles madagascar and bourbon but on the
other hand du bois in his voyage in states that there were no
reptiles in bourbon except tortoises and the officier du roi asserts
that before it had been attempted without success to introduce
frogs into mauritius i presume for the purpose of eating hence it may
be well doubted whether this frog is an aboriginal of these islands 
the absence of the frog family in the oceanic islands is the more
remarkable when contrasted with the case of lizards which swarm on
most of the smallest islands may this difference not be caused by
the greater facility with which the eggs of lizards protected by
calcareous shells might be transported through salt-water than could
the slimy spawn of frogs 

i will first describe the habits of the tortoise testudo nigra 
formerly called indica which has been so frequently alluded to these
animals are found i believe on all the islands of the archipelago 
certainly on the greater number they frequent in preference the high
damp parts but they likewise live in the lower and arid districts i
have already shown from the numbers which have been caught in a single
day how very numerous they must be some grow to an immense size mr 
lawson an englishman and vice-governor of the colony told us that he
had seen several so large that it required six or eight men to lift
them from the ground and that some had afforded as much as two hundred
pounds of meat the old males are the largest the females rarely
growing to so great a size the male can readily be distinguished from
the female by the greater length of its tail the tortoises which live
on those islands where there is no water or in the lower and arid
parts of the others feed chiefly on the succulent cactus those which
frequent the higher and damp regions eat the leaves of various trees 
a kind of berry called guayavita which is acid and austere and
likewise a pale green filamentous lichen usnera plicata that hangs
from the boughs of the trees 

the tortoise is very fond of water drinking large quantities and
wallowing in the mud the larger islands alone possess springs and
these are always situated towards the central parts and at a
considerable height the tortoises therefore which frequent the
lower districts when thirsty are obliged to travel from a long
distance hence broad and well-beaten paths branch off in every
direction from the wells down to the sea-coast and the spaniards by
following them up first discovered the watering-places when i landed
at chatham island i could not imagine what animal travelled so
methodically along well-chosen tracks near the springs it was a
curious spectacle to behold many of these huge creatures one set
eagerly travelling onwards with outstretched necks and another set
returning after having drunk their fill when the tortoise arrives at
the spring quite regardless of any spectator he buries his head in
the water above his eyes and greedily swallows great mouthfuls at the
rate of about ten in a minute the inhabitants say each animal stays
three or four days in the neighbourhood of the water and then returns
to the lower country but they differed respecting the frequency of
these visits the animal probably regulates them according to the
nature of the food on which it has lived it is however certain 
that tortoises can subsist even on these islands where there is no
other water than what falls during a few rainy days in the year 

i believe it is well ascertained that the bladder of the frog acts as
a reservoir for the moisture necessary to its existence such seems to
be the case with the tortoise for some time after a visit to the
springs their urinary bladders are distended with fluid which is said
gradually to decrease in volume and to become less pure the
inhabitants when walking in the lower district and overcome with
thirst often take advantage of this circumstance and drink the
contents of the bladder if full in one i saw killed the fluid was
quite limpid and had only a very slightly bitter taste the
inhabitants however always first drink the water in the pericardium 
which is described as being best 

the tortoises when purposely moving towards any point travel by night
and day and arrive at their journey s end much sooner than would be
expected the inhabitants from observing marked individuals consider
that they travel a distance of about eight miles in two or three days 
one large tortoise which i watched walked at the rate of sixty yards
in ten minutes that is yards in the hour or four miles a
day allowing a little time for it to eat on the road during the
breeding season when the male and female are together the male utters
a hoarse roar or bellowing which it is said can be heard at the
distance of more than a hundred yards the female never uses her voice 
and the male only at these times so that when the people hear this
noise they know that the two are together they were at this time
 october laying their eggs the female where the soil is sandy 
deposits them together and covers them up with sand but where the
ground is rocky she drops them indiscriminately in any hole mr bynoe
found seven placed in a fissure the egg is white and spherical one
which i measured was seven inches and three-eighths in circumference 
and therefore larger than a hen s egg the young tortoises as soon as
they are hatched fall a prey in great numbers to the carrion-feeding
buzzard the old ones seem generally to die from accidents as from
falling down precipices at least several of the inhabitants told me 
that they never found one dead without some evident cause 

the inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf 
certainly they do not overhear a person walking close behind them i
was always amused when overtaking one of these great monsters as it
was quietly pacing along to see how suddenly the instant i passed it
would draw in its head and legs and uttering a deep hiss fall to the
ground with a heavy sound as if struck dead i frequently got on
their backs and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their
shells they would rise up and walk away but i found it very
difficult to keep my balance the flesh of this animal is largely
employed both fresh and salted and a beautifully clear oil is
prepared from the fat when a tortoise is caught the man makes a slit
in the skin near its tail so as to see inside its body whether the
fat under the dorsal plate is thick if it is not the animal is
liberated and it is said to recover soon from this strange operation 
in order to secure the tortoise it is not sufficient to turn them like
turtle for they are often able to get on their legs again 

there can be little doubt that this tortoise is an aboriginal
inhabitant of the galapagos for it is found on all or nearly all the
islands even on some of the smaller ones where there is no water had
it been an imported species this would hardly have been the case in a
group which has been so little frequented moreover the old bucaniers
found this tortoise in greater numbers even than at present wood and
rogers also in say that it is the opinion of the spaniards that
it is found nowhere else in this quarter of the world it is now
widely distributed but it may be questioned whether it is in any other
place an aboriginal the bones of a tortoise at mauritius associated
with those of the extinct dodo have generally been considered as
belonging to this tortoise if this had been so undoubtedly it must
have been there indigenous but m bibron informs me that he believes
that it was distinct as the species now living there certainly is 

the amblyrhynchus a remarkable genus of lizards is confined to this
archipelago there are two species resembling

 picture 

each other in general form one being terrestrial and the other
aquatic this latter species a cristatus was first characterized by
mr bell who well foresaw from its short broad head and strong
claws of equal length that its habits of life would turn out very
peculiar and different from those of its nearest ally the iguana it
is extremely common on all the islands throughout the group and lives
exclusively on the rocky sea-beaches being never found at least i
never saw one even ten yards in-shore it is a hideous-looking
creature of a dirty black colour stupid and sluggish in its
movements the usual length of a full-grown one is about a yard but
there are some even four feet long a large one weighed twenty pounds 
on the island of albemarle they seem to grow to a greater size than
elsewhere their tails are flattened sideways and all four feet
partially webbed they are occasionally seen some hundred yards from
the shore swimming about and captain collnett in his voyage says 
 they go to sea in herds a-fishing and sun themselves on the rocks 
and may be called alligators in miniature it must not however be
supposed that they live on fish when in the water this lizard swims
with perfect ease and quickness by a serpentine movement of its body
and flattened tail the legs being motionless and closely collapsed on
its sides a seaman on board sank one with a heavy weight attached to
it thinking thus to kill it directly but when an hour afterwards he
drew up the line it was quite active their limbs and strong claws
are admirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and fissured masses
of lava which everywhere form the coast in such situations a group
of six or seven of these hideous reptiles may oftentimes be seen on the
black rocks a few feet above the surf basking in the sun with
outstretched legs 

i opened the stomachs of several and found them largely distended with
minced sea-weed ulvae which grows in thin foliaceous expansions of a
bright green or a dull red colour i do not recollect having observed
this sea-weed in any quantity on the tidal rocks and i have reason to
believe it grows at the bottom of the sea at some little distance from
the coast if such be the case the object of these animals
occasionally going out to sea is explained the stomach contained
nothing but the sea-weed mr baynoe however found a piece of crab
in one but this might have got in accidentally in the same manner as
i have seen a caterpillar in the midst of some lichen in the paunch
of a tortoise the intestines were large as in other herbivorous
animals the nature of this lizard s food as well as the structure of
its tail and feet and the fact of its having been seen voluntarily
swimming out at sea absolutely prove its aquatic habits yet there is
in this respect one strange anomaly namely that when frightened it
will not enter the water hence it is easy to drive these lizards down
to any little point overhanging the sea where they will sooner allow a
person to catch hold of their tails than jump into the water they do
not seem to have any notion of biting but when much frightened they
squirt a drop of fluid from each nostril i threw one several times as
far as i could into a deep pool left by the retiring tide but it
invariably returned in a direct line to the spot where i stood it
swam near the bottom with a very graceful and rapid movement and
occasionally aided itself over the uneven ground with its feet as
soon as it arrived near the edge but still being under water it tried
to conceal itself in the tufts of sea-weed or it entered some crevice 
as soon as it thought the danger was past it crawled out on the dry
rocks and shuffled away as quickly as it could i several times
caught this same lizard by driving it down to a point and though
possessed of such perfect powers of diving and swimming nothing would
induce it to enter the water and as often as i threw it in it
returned in the manner above described perhaps this singular piece of
apparent stupidity may be accounted for by the circumstance that this
reptile has no enemy whatever on shore whereas at sea it must often
fall a prey to the numerous sharks hence probably urged by a fixed
and hereditary instinct that the shore is its place of safety whatever
the emergency may be it there takes refuge 

during our visit in october i saw extremely few small individuals of
this species and none i should think under a year old from this
circumstance it seems probable that the breeding season had not then
commenced i asked several of the inhabitants if they knew where it
laid its eggs they said that they knew nothing of its propagation 
although well acquainted with the eggs of the land kind a fact 
considering how very common this lizard is not a little extraordinary 

we will now turn to the terrestrial species a demarlii with a round
tail and toes without webs this lizard instead of being found like
the other on all the islands is confined to the central part of the
archipelago namely to albemarle james barrington and indefatigable
islands to the southward in charles hood and chatham islands and
to the northward in towers bindloes and abingdon i neither saw nor
heard of any it would appear as if it had been created in the centre
of the archipelago and thence had been dispersed only to a certain
distance some of these lizards inhabit the high and damp parts of the
islands but they are much more numerous in the lower and sterile
districts near the coast i cannot give a more forcible proof of their
numbers than by stating that when we were left at james island we
could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to
pitch our single tent like their brothers the sea-kind they are ugly
animals of a yellowish orange beneath and of a brownish red colour
above from their low facial angle they have a singularly stupid
appearance they are perhaps of a rather less size than the marine
species but several of them weighed between ten and fifteen pounds in
their movements they are lazy and half torpid when not frightened 
they slowly crawl along with their tails and bellies dragging on the
ground they often stop and doze for a minute or two with closed
eyes and hind legs spread out on the parched soil 

they inhabit burrows which they sometimes make between fragments of
lava but more generally on level patches of the soft sandstone-like
tuff the holes do not appear to be very deep and they enter the
ground at a small angle so that when walking over these
lizard-warrens the soil is constantly giving way much to the
annoyance of the tired walker this animal when making its burrow 
works alternately the opposite sides of its body one front leg for a
short time scratches up the soil and throws it towards the hind foot 
which is well placed so as to heave it beyond the mouth of the hole 
that side of the body being tired the other takes up the task and so
on alternately i watched one for a long time till half its body was
buried i then walked up and pulled it by the tail at this it was
greatly astonished and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter 
and then stared me in the face as much as to say what made you pull
my tail 

they feed by day and do not wander far from their burrows if
frightened they rush to them with a most awkward gait except when
running down hill they cannot move very fast apparently from the
lateral position of their legs they are not at all timorous when
attentively watching any one they curl their tails and raising
themselves on their front legs nod their heads vertically with a
quick movement and try to look very fierce but in reality they are
not at all so if one just stamps on the ground down go their tails 
and off they shuffle as quickly as they can i have frequently
observed small fly-eating lizards when watching anything nod their
heads in precisely the same manner but i do not at all know for what
purpose if this amblyrhynchus is held and plagued with a stick it
will bite it very severely but i caught many by the tail and they
never tried to bite me if two are placed on the ground and held
together they will fight and bite each other till blood is drawn 

the individuals and they are the greater number which inhabit the
lower country can scarcely taste a drop of water throughout the year 
but they consume much of the succulent cactus the branches of which
are occasionally broken off by the wind i several times threw a piece
to two or three of them when together and it was amusing enough to see
them trying to seize and carry it away in their mouths like so many
hungry dogs with a bone they eat very deliberately but do not chew
their food the little birds are aware how harmless these creatures
are i have seen one of the thick-billed finches picking at one end of
a piece of cactus which is much relished by all the animals of the
lower region whilst a lizard was eating at the other end and
afterwards the little bird with the utmost indifference hopped on the
back of the reptile 

i opened the stomachs of several and found them full of vegetable
fibres and leaves of different trees especially of an acacia in the
upper region they live chiefly on the acid and astringent berries of
the guayavita under which trees i have seen these lizards and the huge
tortoises feeding together to obtain the acacia-leaves they crawl up
the low stunted trees and it is not uncommon to see a pair quietly
browsing whilst seated on a branch several feet above the ground 
these lizards when cooked yield a white meat which is liked by those
whose stomachs soar above all prejudices 

humboldt has remarked that in intertropical south america all lizards
which inhabit dry regions are esteemed delicacies for the table the
inhabitants state that those which inhabit the upper damp parts drink
water but that the others do not like the tortoises travel up for it
from the lower sterile country at the time of our visit the females
had within their bodies numerous large elongated eggs which they lay
in their burrows the inhabitants seek them for food 

these two species of amblyrhynchus agree as i have already stated in
their general structure and in many of their habits neither have
that rapid movement so characteristic of the genera lacerta and
iguana they are both herbivorous although the kind of vegetation on
which they feed is so very different mr bell has given the name to
the genus from the shortness of the snout indeed the form of the
mouth may almost be compared to that of the tortoise one is led to
suppose that this is an adaptation to their herbivorous appetites it
is very interesting thus to find a well-characterized genus having its
marine and terrestrial species belonging to so confined a portion of
the world the aquatic species is by far the most remarkable because
it is the only existing lizard which lives on marine vegetable
productions as i at first observed these islands are not so
remarkable for the number of the species of reptiles as for that of
the individuals when we remember the well-beaten paths made by the
thousands of huge tortoises the many turtles the great warrens of the
terrestrial amblyrhynchus and the groups of the marine species basking
on the coast-rocks of every island we must admit that there is no
other quarter of the world where this order replaces the herbivorous
mammalia in so extraordinary a manner the geologist on hearing this
will probably refer back in his mind to the secondary epochs when
lizards some herbivorous some carnivorous and of dimensions
comparable only with our existing whales swarmed on the land and in
the sea it is therefore worthy of his observation that this
archipelago instead of possessing a humid climate and rank vegetation 
cannot be considered otherwise than extremely arid and for an
equatorial region remarkably temperate 

to finish with the zoology the fifteen kinds of sea-fish which i
procured here are all new species they belong to twelve genera all
widely distributed with the exception of prionotus of which the four
previously known species live on the eastern side of america of
land-shells i collected sixteen kinds and two marked varieties of
which with the exception of one helix found at tahiti all are
peculiar to this archipelago a single fresh-water shell paludina is
common to tahiti and van diemen s land mr cuming before our voyage
procured here ninety species of sea-shells and this does not include
several species not yet specifically examined of trochus turbo 
monodonta and nassa he has been kind enough to give me the following
interesting results of the ninety shells no less than forty-seven are
unknown elsewhere a wonderful fact considering how widely distributed
sea-shells generally are of the forty-three shells found in other
parts of the world twenty-five inhabit the western coast of america 
and of these eight are distinguishable as varieties the remaining
eighteen including one variety were found by mr cuming in the low
archipelago and some of them also at the philippines this fact of
shells from islands in the central parts of the pacific occurring here 
deserves notice for not one single sea-shell is known to be common to
the islands of that ocean and to the west coast of america the space
of open sea running north and south off the west coast separates two
quite distinct conchological provinces but at the galapagos
archipelago we have a halting-place where many new forms have been
created and whither these two great conchological provinces have each
sent up several colonists the american province has also sent here
representative species for there is a galapageian species of
monoceros a genus only found on the west coast of america and there
are galapageian species of fissurella and cancellaria genera common on
the west coast but not found as i am informed by mr cuming in the
central islands of the pacific on the other hand there are
galapageian species of oniscia and stylifer genera common to the west
indies and to the chinese and indian seas but not found either on the
west coast of america or in the central pacific i may here add that
after the comparison by messrs cuming and hinds of about shells
from the eastern and western coasts of america only one single shell
was found in common namely the purpura patula which inhabits the
west indies the coast of panama and the galapagos we have 
therefore in this quarter of the world three great conchological
sea-provinces quite distinct though surprisingly near each other 
being separated by long north and south spaces either of land or of
open sea 

i took great pains in collecting the insects but excepting tierra del
fuego i never saw in this respect so poor a country even in the upper
and damp region i procured very few excepting some minute diptera and
hymenoptera mostly of common mundane forms as before remarked the
insects for a tropical region are of very small size and dull
colours of beetles i collected twenty-five species excluding a
dermestes and corynetes imported wherever a ship touches of these 
two belong to the harpalidae two to the hydrophilidae nine to three
families of the heteromera and the remaining twelve to as many
different families this circumstance of insects and i may add
plants where few in number belonging to many different families is 
i believe very general mr waterhouse who has published an
account of the insects of this archipelago and to whom i am indebted
for the above details informs me that there are several new genera 
and that of the genera not new one or two are american and the rest
of mundane distribution with the exception of a wood-feeding apate 
and of one or probably two water-beetles from the american continent 
all the species appear to be new 

the botany of this group is fully as interesting as the zoology dr 
j hooker will soon publish in the linnean transactions a full
account of the flora and i am much indebted to him for the following
details of flowering plants there are as far as at present is known 
 species and cryptogamic species making altogether of this
number i was fortunate enough to bring home of the flowering
plants are new species and are probably confined to this
archipelago dr hooker conceives that of the plants not so confined 
at least species found near the cultivated ground at charles island 
have been imported it is i think surprising that more american
species have not been introduced naturally considering that the
distance is only between and miles from the continent and that
 according to collnet p drift-wood bamboos canes and the nuts
of a palm are often washed on the south-eastern shores the
proportion of flowering plants out of or excluding the
imported weeds being new is sufficient i conceive to make the
galapagos archipelago a distinct botanical province but this flora is
not nearly so peculiar as that of st helena nor as i am informed by
dr hooker of juan fernandez the peculiarity of the galapageian
flora is best shown in certain families thus there are species of
compositae of which are peculiar to this archipelago these belong
to twelve genera and of these genera no less than ten are confined to
the archipelago dr hooker informs me that the flora has an
undoubtedly western american character nor can he detect in it any
affinity with that of the pacific if therefore we except the
eighteen marine the one fresh-water and one land-shell which have
apparently come here as colonists from the central islands of the
pacific and likewise the one distinct pacific species of the
galapageian group of finches we see that this archipelago though
standing in the pacific ocean is zoologically part of america 

if this character were owing merely to immigrants from america there
would be little remarkable in it but we see that a vast majority of
all the land animals and that more than half of the flowering plants 
are aboriginal productions it was most striking to be surrounded by new
birds new reptiles new shells new insects new plants and yet by
innumerable trifling details of structure and even by the tones of
voice and plumage of the birds to have the temperate plains of
patagonia or rather the hot dry deserts of northern chile vividly
brought before my eyes why on these small points of land which
within a late geological period must have been covered by the ocean 
which are formed by basaltic lava and therefore differ in geological
character from the american continent and which are placed under a
peculiar climate why were their aboriginal inhabitants associated i
may add in different proportions both in kind and number from those on
the continent and therefore acting on each other in a different
manner why were they created on american types of organization it is
probable that the islands of the cape de verd group resemble in all
their physical conditions far more closely the galapagos islands than
these latter physically resemble the coast of america yet the
aboriginal inhabitants of the two groups are totally unlike those of
the cape de verd islands bearing the impress of africa as the
inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago are stamped with that of
america 

i have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the
natural history of this archipelago it is that the different islands
to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings my
attention was first called to this fact by the vice-governor mr 
lawson declaring that the tortoises differed from the different
islands and that he could with certainty tell from which island any
one was brought i did not for some time pay sufficient attention to
this statement and i had already partially mingled together the
collections from two of the islands i never dreamed that islands 
about or miles apart and most of them in sight of each other 
formed of precisely the same rocks placed under a quite similar
climate rising to a nearly equal height would have been differently
tenanted but we shall soon see that this is the case it is the fate
of most voyagers no sooner to discover what is most interesting in any
locality than they are hurried from it but i ought perhaps to be
thankful that i obtained sufficient materials to establish this most
remarkable fact in the distribution of organic beings 

the inhabitants as i have said state that they can distinguish the
tortoises from the different islands and that they differ not only in
size but in other characters captain porter has described those
from charles and from the nearest island to it namely hood island as
having their shells in front thick and turned up like a spanish saddle 
whilst the tortoises from james island are rounder blacker and have a
better taste when cooked m bibron moreover informs me that he has
seen what he considers two distinct species of tortoise from the
galapagos but he does not know from which islands the specimens that
i brought from three islands were young ones and probably owing to
this cause neither mr gray nor myself could find in them any specific
differences i have remarked that the marine amblyrhynchus was larger
at albemarle island than elsewhere and m bibron informs me that he
has seen two distinct aquatic species of this genus so that the
different islands probably have their representative species or races
of the amblyrhynchus as well as of the tortoise my attention was
first thoroughly aroused by comparing together the numerous specimens 
shot by myself and several other parties on board of the
mocking-thrushes when to my astonishment i discovered that all those
from charles island belonged to one species mimus trifasciatus all
from albemarle island to m parvulus and all from james and chatham
islands between which two other islands are situated as connecting
links belonged to m melanotis these two latter species are closely
allied and would by some ornithologists be considered as only
well-marked races or varieties but the mimus trifasciatus is very
distinct unfortunately most of the specimens of the finch tribe were
mingled together but i have strong reasons to suspect that some of the
species of the sub-group geospiza are confined to separate islands if
the different islands have their representatives of geospiza it may
help to explain the singularly large number of the species of this
sub-group in this one small archipelago and as a probable consequence
of their numbers the perfectly graduated series in the size of their
beaks two species of the sub-group cactornis and two of the
camarhynchus were procured in the archipelago and of the numerous
specimens of these two sub-groups shot by four collectors at james
island all were found to belong to one species of each whereas the
numerous specimens shot either on chatham or charles island for the
two sets were mingled together all belonged to the two other species 
hence we may feel almost sure that these islands possess their
respective species of these two sub-groups in land-shells this law of
distribution does not appear to hold good in my very small collection
of insects mr waterhouse remarks that of those which were ticketed
with their locality not one was common to any two of the islands 

if we now turn to the flora we shall find the aboriginal plants of the
different islands wonderfully different i give all the following
results on the high authority of my friend dr j hooker i may
premise that i indiscriminately collected everything in flower on the
different islands and fortunately kept my collections separate too
much confidence however must not be placed in the proportional
results as the small collections brought home by some other
naturalists though in some respects confirming the results plainly
show that much remains to be done in the botany of this group the
leguminosae moreover has as yet been only approximately worked out

hence we have the truly wonderful fact that in james island of the
thirty-eight galapageian plants or those found in no other part of the
world thirty are exclusively confined to this one island and in
albemarle island of the twenty-six aboriginal galapageian plants 
twenty-two are confined to this one island that is only four are at
present known to grow in the other islands of the archipelago and so
on as shown in the above table with the plants from chatham and
charles islands this fact will perhaps be rendered even more
striking by giving a few illustrations thus scalesia a remarkable
arborescent genus of the compositae is confined to the archipelago it
has six species one from chatham one from albemarle one from charles
island two from james island and the sixth from one of the three
latter islands but it is not known from which not one of these six
species grows on any two islands again euphorbia a mundane or
widely distributed genus has here eight species of which seven are
confined to the archipelago and not one found on any two islands 
acalypha and borreria both mundane genera have respectively six and
seven species none of which have the same species on two islands with
the exception of one borreria which does occur on two islands the
species of the compositae are particularly local and dr hooker has
furnished me with several other most striking illustrations of the
difference of the species on the different islands he remarks that
this law of distribution holds good both with those genera confined to
the archipelago and those distributed in other quarters of the world 
in like manner we have seen that the different islands have their
proper species of the mundane genus of tortoise and of the widely
distributed american genus of the mocking-thrush as well as of two of
the galapageian sub-groups of finches and almost certainly of the
galapageian genus amblyrhynchus 

the distribution of the tenants of this archipelago would not be nearly
so wonderful if for instance one island had a mocking-thrush and a
second island some other quite distinct genus if one island had its
genus of lizard and a second island another distinct genus or none
whatever or if the different islands were inhabited not by
representative species of the same genera of plants but by totally
different genera as does to a certain extent hold good for to give
one instance a large berry-bearing tree at james island has no
representative species in charles island but it is the circumstance 
that several of the islands possess their own species of the tortoise 
mocking-thrush finches and numerous plants these species having the
same general habits occupying analogous situations and obviously
filling the same place in the natural economy of this archipelago that
strikes me with wonder it may be suspected that some of these
representative species at least in the case of the tortoise and of
some of the birds may hereafter prove to be only well-marked races 
but this would be of equally great interest to the philosophical
naturalist i have said that most of the islands are in sight of each
other i may specify that charles island is fifty miles from the
nearest part of chatham island and thirty-three miles from the nearest
part of albemarle island chatham island is sixty miles from the
nearest part of james island but there are two intermediate islands
between them which were not visited by me james island is only ten
miles from the nearest part of albemarle island but the two points
where the collections were made are thirty-two miles apart i must
repeat that neither the nature of the soil nor height of the land 
nor the climate nor the general character of the associated beings 
and therefore their action one on another can differ much in the
different islands if there be any sensible difference in their
climates it must be between the windward group namely charles and
chatham islands and that to leeward but there seems to be no
corresponding difference in the productions of these two halves of the
archipelago 

the only light which i can throw on this remarkable difference in the
inhabitants of the different islands is that very strong currents of
the sea running in a westerly and w n w direction must separate as
far as transportal by the sea is concerned the southern islands from
the northern ones and between these northern islands a strong n w 
current was observed which must effectually separate james and
albemarle islands as the archipelago is free to a most remarkable
degree from gales of wind neither the birds insects nor lighter
seeds would be blown from island to island and lastly the profound
depth of the ocean between the islands and their apparently recent in
a geological sense volcanic origin render it highly unlikely that
they were ever united and this probably is a far more important
consideration than any other with respect to the geographical
distribution of their inhabitants reviewing the facts here given one
is astonished at the amount of creative force if such an expression
may be used displayed on these small barren and rocky islands and
still more so at its diverse yet analogous action on points so near
each other i have said that the galapagos archipelago might be called
a satellite attached to america but it should rather be called a group
of satellites physically similar organically distinct yet intimately
related to each other and all related in a marked though much lesser
degree to the great american continent 

i will conclude my description of the natural history of these islands 
by giving an account of the extreme tameness of the birds 

this disposition is common to all the terrestrial species namely to
the mocking-thrushes the finches wrens tyrant-flycatchers the dove 
and carrion-buzzard all of them are often approached sufficiently
near to be killed with a switch and sometimes as i myself tried with
a cap or hat a gun is here almost superfluous for with the muzzle i
pushed a hawk off the branch of a tree one day whilst lying down a
mocking-thrush alighted on the edge of a pitcher made of the shell of
a tortoise which i held in my hand and began very quietly to sip the
water it allowed me to lift it from the ground whilst seated on the
vessel i often tried and very nearly succeeded in catching these
birds by their legs formerly the birds appear to have been even tamer
than at present cowley in the year says that the turtledoves
were so tame that they would often alight on our hats and arms so as
that we could take them alive they not fearing man until such time as
some of our company did fire at them whereby they were rendered more
shy dampier also in the same year says that a man in a morning s
walk might kill six or seven dozen of these doves at present 
although certainly very tame they do not alight on people s arms nor
do they suffer themselves to be killed in such large numbers it is
surprising that they have not become wilder for these islands during
the last hundred and fifty years have been frequently visited by
bucaniers and whalers and the sailors wandering through the wood in
search of tortoises always take cruel delight in knocking down the
little birds these birds although now still more persecuted do not
readily become wild in charles island which had then been colonized
about six years i saw a boy sitting by a well with a switch in his
hand with which he killed the doves and finches as they came to drink 
he had already procured a little heap of them for his dinner and he
said that he had constantly been in the habit of waiting by this well
for the same purpose it would appear that the birds of this
archipelago not having as yet learnt that man is a more dangerous
animal than the tortoise or the amblyrhynchus disregard him in the
same manner as in england shy birds such as magpies disregard the
cows and horses grazing in our fields 

the falkland islands offer a second instance of birds with a similar
disposition the extraordinary tameness of the little opetiorhynchus
has been remarked by pernety lesson and other voyagers it is not 
however peculiar to that bird the polyborus snipe upland and
lowland goose thrush bunting and even some true hawks are all more
or less tame as the birds are so tame there where foxes hawks and
owls occur we may infer that the absence of all rapacious animals at
the galapagos is not the cause of their tameness here the upland
geese at the falklands show by the precaution they take in building on
the islets that they are aware of their danger from the foxes but
they are not by this rendered wild towards man this tameness of the
birds especially of the water-fowl is strongly contrasted with the
habits of the same species in tierra del fuego where for ages past
they have been persecuted by the wild inhabitants in the falklands 
the sportsman may sometimes kill more of the upland geese in one day
than he can carry home whereas in tierra del fuego it is nearly as
difficult to kill one as it is in england to shoot the common wild
goose 

in the time of pernety all the birds there appear to have been
much tamer than at present he states that the opetiorhynchus would
almost perch on his finger and that with a wand he killed ten in half
an hour at that period the birds must have been about as tame as they
now are at the galapagos they appear to have learnt caution more
slowly at these latter islands than at the falklands where they have
had proportionate means of experience for besides frequent visits from
vessels those islands have been at intervals colonized during the
entire period even formerly when all the birds were so tame it was
impossible by pernety s account to kill the black-necked swan a bird
of passage which probably brought with it the wisdom learnt in foreign
countries 

i may add that according to du bois all the birds at bourbon in
with the exception of the flamingoes and geese were so
extremely tame that they could be caught by the hand or killed in any
number with a stick again at tristan d acunha in the atlantic 
carmichael states that the only two land-birds a thrush and a
bunting were so tame as to suffer themselves to be caught with a
hand-net from these several facts we may i think conclude first 
that the wildness of birds with regard to man is a particular instinct
directed against him and not dependent upon any general degree of
caution arising from other sources of danger secondly that it is not
acquired by individual birds in a short time even when much
persecuted but that in the course of successive generations it becomes
hereditary with domesticated animals we are accustomed to see new
mental habits or instincts acquired or rendered hereditary but with
animals in a state of nature it must always be most difficult to
discover instances of acquired hereditary knowledge in regard to the
wildness of birds towards man there is no way of accounting for it 
except as an inherited habit comparatively few young birds in any one
year have been injured by man in england yet almost all even
nestlings are afraid of him many individuals on the other hand both
at the galapagos and at the falklands have been pursued and injured by
man yet have not learned a salutary dread of him we may infer from
these facts what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must
cause in a country before the instincts of the indigenous inhabitants
have become adapted to the stranger s craft or power 

 the progress of research has shown that some of these birds which
were then thought to be confined to the islands occur on the american
continent the eminent ornithologist mr sclater informs me that
this is the case with the strix punctatissima and pyrocephalus nanus 
and probably with the otus galapagoensis and zenaida galapagoensis so
that the number of endemic birds is reduced to twenty-three or
probably to twenty-one mr sclater thinks that one or two of these
endemic forms should be ranked rather as varieties than species which
always seemed to me probable 

 this is stated by dr gunther zoolog soc jan th to be a
peculiar species not known to inhabit any other country

october th the survey of the galapagos archipelago being concluded 
we steered towards tahiti and commenced our long passage of miles 
in the course of a few days we sailed out of the gloomy and clouded
ocean-district which extends during the winter far from the coast of
south america we then enjoyed bright and clear weather while running
pleasantly along at the rate of or miles a day before the
steady trade-wind the temperature in this more central part of the
pacific is higher than near the american shore the thermometer in the
poop cabin by night and day ranged between and degs which
feels very pleasant but with one degree or two higher the heat
becomes oppressive we passed through the low or dangerous
archipelago and saw several of those most curious rings of coral land 
just rising above the water s edge which have been called lagoon
islands a long and brilliantly white beach is capped by a margin of
green vegetation and the strip looking either way rapidly narrows
away in the distance and sinks beneath the horizon from the mast-head
a wide expanse of smooth water can be seen within the ring these low
hollow coral islands bear no proportion to the vast ocean out of which
they abruptly rise and it seems wonderful that such weak invaders are
not overwhelmed by the all-powerful and never-tiring waves of that
great sea miscalled the pacific 

november th at daylight tahiti an island which must for ever
remain classical to the voyager in the south sea was in view at a
distance the appearance was not attractive the luxuriant vegetation
of the lower part could not yet be seen and as the clouds rolled past 
the wildest and most precipitous peaks showed themselves towards the
centre of the island as soon as we anchored in matavai bay we were
surrounded by canoes this was our sunday but the monday of tahiti 
if the case had been reversed we should not have received a single
visit for the injunction not to launch a canoe on the sabbath is
rigidly obeyed after dinner we landed to enjoy all the delights
produced by the first impressions of a new country and that country
the charming tahiti a crowd of men women and children was
collected on the memorable point venus ready to receive us with
laughing merry faces they marshalled us towards the house of mr 
wilson the missionary of the district who met us on the road and
gave us a very friendly reception after sitting a very short time in
his house we separated to walk about but returned there in the
evening 

the land capable of cultivation is scarcely in any part more than a
fringe of low alluvial soil accumulated round the base of the
mountains and protected from the waves of the sea by a coral reef 
which encircles the entire line of coast within the reef there is an
expanse of smooth water like that of a lake where the canoes of the
natives can ply with safety and where ships anchor the low land which
comes down to the beach of coral-sand is covered by the most beautiful
productions of the intertropical regions in the midst of bananas 
orange cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees spots are cleared where yams 
sweet potatoes and sugar-cane and pine-apples are cultivated even
the brushwood is an imported fruit-tree namely the guava which from
its abundance has become as noxious as a weed in brazil i have often
admired the varied beauty of the bananas palms and orange-trees
contrasted together and here we also have the bread-fruit conspicuous
from its large glossy and deeply digitated leaf it is admirable to
behold groves of a tree sending forth its branches with the vigour of
an english oak loaded with large and most nutritious fruit however
seldom the usefulness of an object can account for the pleasure of
beholding it in the case of these beautiful woods the knowledge of
their high productiveness no doubt enters largely into the feeling of
admiration the little winding paths cool from the surrounding shade 
led to the scattered houses the owners of which everywhere gave us a
cheerful and most hospitable reception 

i was pleased with nothing so much as with the inhabitants there is a
mildness in the expression of their countenances which at once banishes
the idea of a savage and intelligence which shows that they are
advancing in civilization the common people when working keep the
upper part of their bodies quite naked and it is then that the
tahitians are seen to advantage they are very tall broad-shouldered 
athletic and well-proportioned it has been remarked that it
requires little habit to make a dark skin more pleasing and natural to
the eye of an european than his own colour a white man bathing by the
side of a tahitian was like a plant bleached by the gardener s art
compared with a fine dark green one growing vigorously in the open
fields most of the men are tattooed and the ornaments follow the
curvature of the body so gracefully that they have a very elegant
effect one common pattern varying in its details is somewhat like
the crown of a palm-tree it springs from the central line of the back 
and gracefully curls round both sides the simile may be a fanciful
one but i thought the body of a man thus ornamented was like the trunk
of a noble tree embraced by a delicate creeper 

many of the elder people had their feet covered with small figures so
placed as to resemble a sock this fashion however is partly gone
by and has been succeeded by others here although fashion is far
from immutable every one must abide by that prevailing in his youth 
an old man has thus his age for ever stamped on his body and he cannot
assume the airs of a young dandy the women are tattooed in the same
manner as the men and very commonly on their fingers one unbecoming
fashion is now almost universal namely shaving the hair from the
upper part of the head in a circular form so as to leave only an
outer ring the missionaries have tried to persuade the people to
change this habit but it is the fashion and that is a sufficient
answer at tahiti as well as at paris i was much disappointed in the
personal appearance of the women they are far inferior in every
respect to the men the custom of wearing a white or scarlet flower in
the back of the head or through a small hole in each ear is pretty a
crown of woven cocoa-nut leaves is also worn as a shade for the eyes 
the women appear to be in greater want of some becoming costume even
than the men 

nearly all the natives understand a little english that is they know
the names of common things and by the aid of this together with
signs a lame sort of conversation could be carried on in returning
in the evening to the boat we stopped to witness a very pretty scene 
numbers of children were playing on the beach and had lighted bonfires
which illumined the placid sea and surrounding trees others in
circles were singing tahitian verses we seated ourselves on the
sand and joined their party the songs were impromptu and i believe
related to our arrival one little girl sang a line which the rest
took up in parts forming a very pretty chorus the whole scene made
us unequivocally aware that we were seated on the shores of an island
in the far-famed south sea 

th this day is reckoned in the log-book as tuesday the th 
instead of monday the th owing to our so far successful chase of
the sun before breakfast the ship was hemmed in by a flotilla of
canoes and when the natives were allowed to come on board i suppose
there could not have been less than two hundred it was the opinion of
every one that it would have been difficult to have picked out an equal
number from any other nation who would have given so little trouble 
everybody brought something for sale shells were the main articles of
trade the tahitians now fully understand the value of money and
prefer it to old clothes or other articles the various coins 
however of english and spanish denomination puzzle them and they
never seemed to think the small silver quite secure until changed into
dollars some of the chiefs have accumulated considerable sums of
money one chief not long since offered dollars about 
pounds sterling for a small vessel and frequently they purchase
whale-boats and horses at the rate of from to dollars 

after breakfast i went on shore and ascended the nearest slope to a
height of between two and three thousand feet the outer mountains are
smooth and conical but steep and the old volcanic rocks of which
they are formed have been cut through by many profound ravines 
diverging from the central broken parts of the island to the coast 
having crossed the narrow low girt of inhabited and fertile land i
followed a smooth steep ridge between two of the deep ravines the
vegetation was singular consisting almost exclusively of small dwarf
ferns mingled higher up with coarse grass it was not very dissimilar
from that on some of the welsh hills and this so close above the
orchard of tropical plants on the coast was very surprising at the
highest point which i reached trees again appeared of the three
zones of comparative luxuriance the lower one owes its moisture and
therefore fertility to its flatness for being scarcely raised above
the level of the sea the water from the higher land drains away
slowly the intermediate zone does not like the upper one reach into
a damp and cloudy atmosphere and therefore remains sterile the woods
in the upper zone are very pretty tree-ferns replacing the cocoa-nuts
on the coast it must not however be supposed that these woods at
all equal in splendour the forests of brazil the vast numbers of
productions which characterize a continent cannot be expected to
occur in an island 

from the highest point which i attained there was a good view of the
distant island of eimeo dependent on the same sovereign with tahiti 
on the lofty and broken pinnacles white massive clouds were piled up 
which formed an island in the blue sky as eimeo itself did in the blue
ocean the island with the exception of one small gateway is
completely encircled by a reef at this distance a narrow but
well-defined brilliantly white line was alone visible where the waves
first encountered the wall of coral the mountains rose abruptly out
of the glassy expanse of the lagoon included within this narrow white
line outside which the heaving waters of the ocean were dark-coloured 
the view was striking it may aptly be compared to a framed engraving 
where the frame represents the breakers the marginal paper the smooth
lagoon and the drawing the island itself when in the evening i
descended from the mountain a man whom i had pleased with a trifling
gift met me bringing with him hot roasted bananas a pine-apple and
cocoa-nuts after walking under a burning sun i do not know anything
more delicious than the milk of a young cocoa-nut pine-apples are
here so abundant that the people eat them in the same wasteful manner
as we might turnips they are of an excellent flavor perhaps even
better than those cultivated in england and this i believe is the
highest compliment which can be paid to any fruit before going on
board mr wilson interpreted for me to the tahitian who had paid me so
adroit an attention that i wanted him and another man to accompany me
on a short excursion into the mountains 

th in the morning i came on shore early bringing with me some
provisions in a bag and two blankets for myself and servant these
were lashed to each end of a long pole which was alternately carried
by my tahitian companions on their shoulders these men are accustomed
thus to carry for a whole day as much as fifty pounds at each end of
their poles i told my guides to provide themselves with food and
clothing but they said that there was plenty of food in the mountains 
and for clothing that their skins were sufficient our line of march
was the valley of tiaauru down which a river flows into the sea by
point venus this is one of the principal streams in the island and
its source lies at the base of the loftiest central pinnacles which
rise to a height of about feet the whole island is so
mountainous that the only way to penetrate into the interior is to
follow up the valleys our road at first lay through woods which
bordered each side of the river and the glimpses of the lofty central
peaks seen as through an avenue with here and there a waving
cocoa-nut tree on one side were extremely picturesque the valley
soon began to narrow and the sides to grow lofty and more precipitous 
after having walked between three and four hours we found the width of
the ravine scarcely exceeded that of the bed of the stream on each
hand the walls were nearly vertical yet from the soft nature of the
volcanic strata trees and a rank vegetation sprung from every
projecting ledge these precipices must have been some thousand feet
high and the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than
anything which i had ever before beheld until the midday sun stood
vertically over the ravine the air felt cool and damp but now it
became very sultry shaded by a ledge of rock beneath a facade of
columnar lava we ate our dinner my guides had already procured a
dish of small fish and fresh-water prawns they carried with them a
small net stretched on a hoop and where the water was deep and in
eddies they dived and like otters with their eyes open followed the
fish into holes and corners and thus caught them 

the tahitians have the dexterity of amphibious animals in the water an
anecdote mentioned by ellis shows how much they feel at home in this
element when a horse was landing for pomarre in the slings
broke and it fell into the water immediately the natives jumped
overboard and by their cries and vain efforts at assistance almost
drowned it as soon however as it reached the shore the whole
population took to flight and tried to hide themselves from the
man-carrying pig as they christened the horse 

a little higher up the river divided itself into three little streams 
the two northern ones were impracticable owing to a succession of
waterfalls which descended from the jagged summit of the highest
mountain the other to all appearance was equally inaccessible but we
managed to ascend it by a most extraordinary road the sides of the
valley were here nearly precipitous but as frequently happens with
stratified rocks small ledges projected which were thickly covered by
wild bananas lilaceous plants and other luxuriant productions of the
tropics the tahitians by climbing amongst these ledges searching
for fruit had discovered a track by which the whole precipice could be
scaled the first ascent from the valley was very dangerous for it was
necessary to pass a steeply inclined face of naked rock by the aid of
ropes which we brought with us how any person discovered that this
formidable spot was the only point where the side of the mountain was
practicable i cannot imagine we then cautiously walked along one of
the ledges till we came to one of the three streams this ledge formed
a flat spot above which a beautiful cascade some hundred feet in
height poured down its waters and beneath another high cascade fell
into the main stream in the valley below from this cool and shady
recess we made a circuit to avoid the overhanging waterfall as
before we followed little projecting ledges the danger being partly
concealed by the thickness of the vegetation in passing from one of
the ledges to another there was a vertical wall of rock one of the
tahitians a fine active man placed the trunk of a tree against this 
climbed up it and then by the aid of crevices reached the summit he
fixed the ropes to a projecting point and lowered them for our dog and
luggage and then we clambered up ourselves beneath the ledge on
which the dead tree was placed the precipice must have been five or
six hundred feet deep and if the abyss had not been partly concealed
by the overhanging ferns and lilies my head would have turned giddy 
and nothing should have induced me to have attempted it we continued
to ascend sometimes along ledges and sometimes along knife-edged
ridges having on each hand profound ravines in the cordillera i have
seen mountains on a far grander scale but for abruptness nothing at
all comparable with this in the evening we reached a flat little spot
on the banks of the same stream which we had continued to follow and
which descends in a chain of waterfalls here we bivouacked for the
night on each side of the ravine there were great beds of the
mountain-banana covered with ripe fruit many of these plants were
from twenty to twenty-five feet high and from three to four in
circumference by the aid of strips of bark for rope the stems of
bamboos for rafters and the large leaf of the banana for a thatch the
tahitians in a few minutes built us an excellent house and with
withered leaves made a soft bed 

they then proceeded to make a fire and cook our evening meal a light
was procured by rubbing a blunt pointed stick in a groove made in
another as if with intention of deepening it until by the friction
the dust became ignited a peculiarly white and very light wood the
hibiscus tiliareus is alone used for this purpose it is the same
which serves for poles to carry any burden and for the floating
out-riggers to their canoes the fire was produced in a few seconds 
but to a person who does not understand the art it requires as i
found the greatest exertion but at last to my great pride i
succeeded in igniting the dust the gaucho in the pampas uses a
different method taking an elastic stick about eighteen inches long 
he presses one end on his breast and the other pointed end into a hole
in a piece of wood and then rapidly turns the curved part like a
carpenter s centre-bit the tahitians having made a small fire of
sticks placed a score of stones of about the size of cricket-balls 
on the burning wood in about ten minutes the sticks were consumed 
and the stones hot they had previously folded up in small parcels of
leaves pieces of beef fish ripe and unripe bananas and the tops of
the wild arum these green parcels were laid in a layer between two
layers of the hot stones and the whole then covered up with earth so
that no smoke or steam could escape in about a quarter of an hour 
the whole was most deliciously cooked the choice green parcels were
now laid on a cloth of banana leaves and with a cocoa-nut shell we
drank the cool water of the running stream and thus we enjoyed our
rustic meal 

i could not look on the surrounding plants without admiration on every
side were forests of banana the fruit of which though serving for
food in various ways lay in heaps decaying on the ground in front of
us there was an extensive brake of wild sugar-cane and the stream was
shaded by the dark green knotted stem of the ava so famous in former
days for its powerful intoxicating effects i chewed a piece and
found that it had an acrid and unpleasant taste which would have
induced any one at once to have pronounced it poisonous thanks to the
missionaries this plant now thrives only in these deep ravines 
innocuous to every one close by i saw the wild arum the roots of
which when well baked are good to eat and the young leaves better
than spinach there was the wild yam and a liliaceous plant called
ti which grows in abundance and has a soft brown root in shape and
size like a huge log of wood this served us for dessert for it is as
sweet as treacle and with a pleasant taste there were moreover 
several other wild fruits and useful vegetables the little stream 
besides its cool water produced eels and cray-fish i did indeed
admire this scene when i compared it with an uncultivated one in the
temperate zones i felt the force of the remark that man at least
savage man with his reasoning powers only partly developed is the
child of the tropics 

as the evening drew to a close i strolled beneath the gloomy shade of
the bananas up the course of the stream my walk was soon brought to a
close by coming to a waterfall between two and three hundred feet
high and again above this there was another i mention all these
waterfalls in this one brook to give a general idea of the inclination
of the land in the little recess where the water fell it did not
appear that a breath of wind had ever blown the thin edges of the
great leaves of the banana damp with spray were unbroken instead of
being as is so generally the case split into a thousand shreds from
our position almost suspended on the mountain side there were
glimpses into the depths of the neighbouring valleys and the lofty
points of the central mountains towering up within sixty degrees of
the zenith hid half the evening sky thus seated it was a sublime
spectacle to watch the shades of night gradually obscuring the last and
highest pinnacles 

before we laid ourselves down to sleep the elder tahitian fell on his
knees and with closed eyes repeated a long prayer in his native
tongue he prayed as a christian should do with fitting reverence 
and without the fear of ridicule or any ostentation of piety at our
meals neither of the men would taste food without saying beforehand a
short grace those travellers who think that a tahitian prays only when
the eyes of the missionary are fixed on him should have slept with us
that night on the mountain-side before morning it rained very
heavily but the good thatch of banana-leaves kept us dry 

november th at daylight my friends after their morning prayer 
prepared an excellent breakfast in the same manner as in the evening 
they themselves certainly partook of it largely indeed i never saw any
men eat near so much i suppose such enormously capacious stomachs
must be the effect of a large part of their diet consisting of fruit
and vegetables which contain in a given bulk a comparatively small
portion of nutriment unwittingly i was the means of my companions
breaking as i afterwards learned one of their own laws and
resolutions i took with me a flask of spirits which they could not
refuse to partake of but as often as they drank a little they put
their fingers before their mouths and uttered the word missionary 
about two years ago although the use of the ava was prevented 
drunkenness from the introduction of spirits became very prevalent the
missionaries prevailed on a few good men who saw that their country
was rapidly going to ruin to join with them in a temperance society 
from good sense or shame all the chiefs and the queen were at last
persuaded to join immediately a law was passed that no spirits
should be allowed to be introduced into the island and that he who
sold and he who bought the forbidden article should be punished by a
fine with remarkable justice a certain period was allowed for stock
in hand to be sold before the law came into effect but when it did 
a general search was made in which even the houses of the missionaries
were not exempted and all the ava as the natives call all ardent
spirits was poured on the ground when one reflects on the effect of
intemperance on the aborigines of the two americas i think it will be
acknowledged that every well-wisher of tahiti owes no common debt of
gratitude to the missionaries as long as the little island of st 
helena remained under the government of the east india company 
spirits owing to the great injury they had produced were not allowed
to be imported but wine was supplied from the cape of good hope it
is rather a striking and not very gratifying fact that in the same
year that spirits were allowed to be sold in helena their use was
banished from tahiti by the free will of the people 

after breakfast we proceeded on our journey as my object was merely
to see a little of the interior scenery we returned by another track 
which descended into the main valley lower down for some distance we
wound by a most intricate path along the side of the mountain which
formed the valley in the less precipitous parts we passed through
extensive groves of the wild banana the tahitians with their naked 
tattooed bodies their heads ornamented with flowers and seen in the
dark shade of these groves would have formed a fine picture of man
inhabiting some primeval land in our descent we followed the line of
ridges these were exceedingly narrow and for considerable lengths
steep as a ladder but all clothed with vegetation the extreme care
necessary in poising each step rendered the walk fatiguing i did not
cease to wonder at these ravines and precipices when viewing the
country from one of the knife-edged ridges the point of support was so
small that the effect was nearly the same as it must be from a
balloon in this descent we had occasion to use the ropes only once 
at the point where we entered the main valley we slept under the same
ledge of rock where we had dined the day before the night was fine 
but from the depth and narrowness of the gorge profoundly dark 

before actually seeing this country i found it difficult to understand
two facts mentioned by ellis namely that after the murderous battles
of former times the survivors on the conquered side retired into the
mountains where a handful of men could resist a multitude certainly
half a dozen men at the spot where the tahitian reared the old tree 
could easily have repulsed thousands secondly that after the
introduction of christianity there were wild men who lived in the
mountains and whose retreats were unknown to the more civilized
inhabitants 

november th in the morning we started early and reached matavai at
noon on the road we met a large party of noble athletic men going
for wild bananas i found that the ship on account of the difficulty
in watering had moved to the harbour of papawa to which place i
immediately walked this is a very pretty spot the cove is
surrounded by reefs and the water as smooth as in a lake the
cultivated ground with its beautiful productions interspersed with
cottages comes close down to the water s edge from the varying
accounts which i had read before reaching these islands i was very
anxious to form from my own observation a judgment of their moral
state although such judgment would necessarily be very imperfect 
first impressions at all times very much depend on one s previously
acquired ideas my notions were drawn from ellis s polynesian
researches an admirable and most interesting work but naturally
looking at everything under a favourable point of view from beechey s
voyage and from that of kotzebue which is strongly adverse to the
whole missionary system he who compares these three accounts will i
think form a tolerably accurate conception of the present state of
tahiti one of my impressions which i took from the two last
authorities was decidedly incorrect viz that the tahitians had
become a gloomy race and lived in fear of the missionaries of the
latter feeling i saw no trace unless indeed fear and respect be
confounded under one name instead of discontent being a common
feeling it would be difficult in europe to pick out of a crowd half so
many merry and happy faces the prohibition of the flute and dancing
is inveighed against as wrong and foolish the more than presbyterian
manner of keeping the sabbath is looked at in a similar light on
these points i will not pretend to offer any opinion to men who have
resided as many years as i was days on the island 

on the whole it appears to me that the morality and religion of the
inhabitants are highly creditable there are many who attack even
more acrimoniously than kotzebue both the missionaries their system 
and the effects produced by it such reasoners never compare the
present state with that of the island only twenty years ago nor even
with that of europe at this day but they compare it with the high
standard of gospel perfection they expect the missionaries to effect
that which the apostles themselves failed to do inasmuch as the
condition of the people falls short of this high standard blame is
attached to the missionary instead of credit for that which he has
effected they forget or will not remember that human sacrifices 
and the power of an idolatrous priesthood a system of profligacy
unparalleled in any other part of the world infanticide a consequence
of that system bloody wars where the conquerors spared neither women
nor children that all these have been abolished and that dishonesty 
intemperance and licentiousness have been greatly reduced by the
introduction of christianity in a voyager to forget these things is
base ingratitude for should he chance to be at the point of shipwreck
on some unknown coast he will most devoutly pray that the lesson of
the missionary may have extended thus far 

in point of morality the virtue of the women it has been often said 
is most open to exception but before they are blamed too severely it
will be well distinctly to call to mind the scenes described by captain
cook and mr banks in which the grandmothers and mothers of the
present race played a part those who are most severe should consider
how much of the morality of the women in europe is owing to the system
early impressed by mothers on their daughters and how much in each
individual case to the precepts of religion but it is useless to
argue against such reasoners i believe that disappointed in not
finding the field of licentiousness quite so open as formerly they
will not give credit to a morality which they do not wish to practise 
or to a religion which they undervalue if not despise 

sunday nd the harbour of papiete where the queen resides may be
considered as the capital of the island it is also the seat of
government and the chief resort of shipping captain fitz roy took a
party there this day to hear divine service first in the tahitian
language and afterwards in our own mr pritchard the leading
missionary in the island performed the service the chapel consisted
of a large airy framework of wood and it was filled to excess by tidy 
clean people of all ages and both sexes i was rather disappointed in
the apparent degree of attention but i believe my expectations were
raised too high at all events the appearance was quite equal to that
in a country church in england the singing of the hymns was decidedly
very pleasing but the language from the pulpit although fluently
delivered did not sound well a constant repetition of words like
 tata ta mata mai rendered it monotonous after english service a
party returned on foot to matavai it was a pleasant walk sometimes
along the sea-beach and sometimes under the shade of the many beautiful
trees 

about two years ago a small vessel under english colours was plundered
by some of the inhabitants of the low islands which were then under
the dominion of the queen of tahiti it was believed that the
perpetrators were instigated to this act by some indiscreet laws issued
by her majesty the british government demanded compensation which
was acceded to and the sum of nearly three thousand dollars was agreed
to be paid on the first of last september the commodore at lima
ordered captain fitz roy to inquire concerning this debt and to demand
satisfaction if it were not paid captain fitz roy accordingly
requested an interview with the queen pomarre since famous from the
ill-treatment she had received from the french and a parliament was
held to consider the question at which all the principal chiefs of the
island and the queen were assembled i will not attempt to describe
what took place after the interesting account given by captain fitz
roy the money it appeared had not been paid perhaps the alleged
reasons were rather equivocal but otherwise i cannot sufficiently
express our general surprise at the extreme good sense the reasoning
powers moderation candour and prompt resolution which were
displayed on all sides i believe we all left the meeting with a very
different opinion of the tahitians from what we entertained when we
entered the chiefs and people resolved to subscribe and complete the
sum which was wanting captain fitz roy urged that it was hard that
their private property should be sacrificed for the crimes of distant
islanders they replied that they were grateful for his
consideration but that pomarre was their queen and that they were
determined to help her in this her difficulty this resolution and its
prompt execution for a book was opened early the next morning made a
perfect conclusion to this very remarkable scene of loyalty and good
feeling 

after the main discussion was ended several of the chiefs took the
opportunity of asking captain fitz roy many intelligent questions on
international customs and laws relating to the treatment of ships and
foreigners on some points as soon as the decision was made the law
was issued verbally on the spot this tahitian parliament lasted for
several hours and when it was over captain fitz roy invited queen
pomarre to pay the beagle a visit 

november th in the evening four boats were sent for her majesty 
the ship was dressed with flags and the yards manned on her coming on
board she was accompanied by most of the chiefs the behaviour of
all was very proper they begged for nothing and seemed much pleased
with captain fitz roy s presents the queen is a large awkward woman 
without any beauty grace or dignity she has only one royal
attribute a perfect immovability of expression under all
circumstances and that rather a sullen one the rockets were most
admired and a deep oh could be heard from the shore all round the
dark bay after each explosion the sailors songs were also much
admired and the queen said she thought that one of the most boisterous
ones certainly could not be a hymn the royal party did not return on
shore till past midnight 

th in the evening with a gentle land-breeze a course was steered
for new zealand and as the sun set we had a farewell view of the
mountains of tahiti the island to which every voyager has offered up
his tribute of admiration 

december th in the evening we saw in the distance new zealand we
may now consider that we have nearly crossed the pacific it is
necessary to sail over this great ocean to comprehend its immensity 
moving quickly onwards for weeks together we meet with nothing but the
same blue profoundly deep ocean even within the archipelagoes the
islands are mere specks and far distant one from the other accustomed
to look at maps drawn on a small scale where dots shading and names
are crowded together we do not rightly judge how infinitely small the
proportion of dry land is to water of this vast expanse the meridian
of the antipodes has likewise been passed and now every league it
made us happy to think was one league nearer to england these
antipodes call to one s mind old recollections of childish doubt and
wonder only the other day i looked forward to this airy barrier as a
definite point in our voyage homewards but now i find it and all such
resting-places for the imagination are like shadows which a man
moving onwards cannot catch a gale of wind lasting for some days has
lately given us full leisure to measure the future stages in our
homeward voyage and to wish most earnestly for its termination 

december st early in the morning we entered the bay of islands and
being becalmed for some hours near the mouth we did not reach the
anchorage till the middle of the day the country is hilly with a
smooth outline and is deeply intersected by numerous arms of the sea
extending from the bay the surface appears from a distance as if
clothed with coarse pasture but this in truth is nothing but fern on
the more distant hills as well as in parts of the valleys there is a
good deal of woodland the general tint of the landscape is not a
bright green and it resembles the country a short distance to the
south of concepcion in chile in several parts of the bay little
villages of square tidy looking houses are scattered close down to the
water s edge three whaling-ships were lying at anchor and a canoe
every now and then crossed from shore to shore with these exceptions 
an air of extreme quietness reigned over the whole district only a
single canoe came alongside this and the aspect of the whole scene 
afforded a remarkable and not very pleasing contrast with our joyful
and boisterous welcome at tahiti 

in the afternoon we went on shore to one of the larger groups of
houses which yet hardly deserves the title of a village its name is
pahia it is the residence of the missionaries and there are no native
residents except servants and labourers in the vicinity of the bay of
islands the number of englishmen including their families amounts to
between two and three hundred all the cottages many of which are
whitewashed and look very neat are the property of the english the
hovels of the natives are so diminutive and paltry that they can
scarcely be perceived from a distance at pahia it was quite pleasing
to behold the english flowers in the gardens before the houses there
were roses of several kinds honeysuckle jasmine stocks and whole
hedges of sweetbrier 

december nd in the morning i went out walking but i soon found
that the country was very impracticable all the hills are thickly
covered with tall fern together with a low bush which grows like a
cypress and very little ground has been cleared or cultivated i then
tried the sea-beach but proceeding towards either hand my walk was
soon stopped by salt-water creeks and deep brooks the communication
between the inhabitants of the different parts of the bay is as in
chiloe almost entirely kept up by boats i was surprised to find that
almost every hill which i ascended had been at some former time more
or less fortified the summits were cut into steps or successive
terraces and frequently they had been protected by deep trenches i
afterwards observed that the principal hills inland in like manner
showed an artificial outline these are the pas so frequently
mentioned by captain cook under the name of hippah the difference of
sound being owing to the prefixed article 

that the pas had formerly been much used was evident from the piles of
shells and the pits in which as i was informed sweet potatoes used
to be kept as a reserve as there was no water on these hills the
defenders could never have anticipated a long siege but only a hurried
attack for plunder against which the successive terraces would have
afforded good protection the general introduction of fire-arms has
changed the whole system of warfare and an exposed situation on the
top of a hill is now worse than useless the pas in consequence are at
the present day always built on a level piece of ground they consist
of a double stockade of thick and tall posts placed in a zigzag line 
so that every part can be flanked within the stockade a mound of
earth is thrown up behind which the defenders can rest in safety or
use their fire-arms over it on the level of the ground little
archways sometimes pass through this breastwork by which means the
defenders can crawl out to the stockade and reconnoitre their enemies 
the rev w williams who gave me this account added that in one pas
he had noticed spurs or buttresses projecting on the inner and
protected side of the mound of earth on asking the chief the use of
them he replied that if two or three of his men were shot their
neighbours would not see the bodies and so be discouraged 

these pas are considered by the new zealanders as very perfect means of
defence for the attacking force is never so well disciplined as to
rush in a body to the stockade cut it down and effect their entry 
when a tribe goes to war the chief cannot order one party to go here
and another there but every man fights in the manner which best
pleases himself and to each separate individual to approach a stockade
defended by fire-arms must appear certain death i should think a more
warlike race of inhabitants could not be found in any part of the world
than the new zealanders their conduct on first seeing a ship as
described by captain cook strongly illustrates this the act of
throwing volleys of stones at so great and novel an object and their
defiance of come on shore and we will kill and eat you all shows
uncommon boldness this warlike spirit is evident in many of their
customs and even in their smallest actions if a new zealander is
struck although but in joke the blow must be returned and of this i
saw an instance with one of our officers 

at the present day from the progress of civilization there is much
less warfare except among some of the southern tribes i heard a
characteristic anecdote of what took place some time ago in the south 
a missionary found a chief and his tribe in preparation for war their
muskets clean and bright and their ammunition ready he reasoned long
on the inutility of the war and the little provocation which had been
given for it the chief was much shaken in his resolution and seemed
in doubt but at length it occurred to him that a barrel of his
gunpowder was in a bad state and that it would not keep much longer 
this was brought forward as an unanswerable argument for the necessity
of immediately declaring war the idea of allowing so much good
gunpowder to spoil was not to be thought of and this settled the
point i was told by the missionaries that in the life of shongi the
chief who visited england the love of war was the one and lasting
spring of every action the tribe in which he was a principal chief
had at one time been oppressed by another tribe from the thames river 
a solemn oath was taken by the men that when their boys should grow up 
and they should be powerful enough they would never forget or forgive
these injuries to fulfil this oath appears to have been shongi s
chief motive for going to england and when there it was his sole
object presents were valued only as they could be converted into
arms of the arts those alone interested him which were connected with
the manufacture of arms when at sydney shongi by a strange
coincidence met the hostile chief of the thames river at the house of
mr marsden their conduct was civil to each other but shongi told him
that when again in new zealand he would never cease to carry war into
his country the challenge was accepted and shongi on his return
fulfilled the threat to the utmost letter the tribe on the thames
river was utterly overthrown and the chief to whom the challenge had
been given was himself killed shongi although harbouring such deep
feelings of hatred and revenge is described as having been a
good-natured person 

in the evening i went with captain fitz roy and mr baker one of the
missionaries to pay a visit to kororadika we wandered about the
village and saw and conversed with many of the people both men 
women and children looking at the new zealander one naturally
compares him with the tahitian both belonging to the same family of
mankind the comparison however tells heavily against the new
zealander he may perhaps be superior in energy but in every other
respect his character is of a much lower order one glance at their
respective expressions brings conviction to the mind that one is a
savage the other a civilized man it would be vain to seek in the
whole of new zealand a person with the face and mien of the old
tahitian chief utamme no doubt the extraordinary manner in which
tattooing is here practised gives a disagreeable expression to their
countenances the complicated but symmetrical figures covering the
whole face puzzle and mislead an unaccustomed eye it is moreover
probable that the deep incisions by destroying the play of the
superficial muscles give an air of rigid inflexibility but besides
this there is a twinkling in the eye which cannot indicate anything
but cunning and ferocity their figures are tall and bulky but not
comparable in elegance with those of the working-classes in tahiti 

but their persons and houses are filthily dirty and offensive the idea
of washing either their bodies or their clothes never seems to enter
their heads i saw a chief who was wearing a shirt black and matted
with filth and when asked how it came to be so dirty he replied with
surprise do not you see it is an old one some of the men have
shirts but the common dress is one or two large blankets generally
black with dirt which are thrown over their shoulders in a very
inconvenient and awkward fashion a few of the principal chiefs have
decent suits of english clothes but these are only worn on great
occasions 

december rd at a place called waimate about fifteen miles from the
bay of islands and midway between the eastern and western coasts the
missionaries have purchased some land for agricultural purposes i had
been introduced to the rev w williams who upon my expressing a
wish invited me to pay him a visit there mr bushby the british
resident offered to take me in his boat by a creek where i should see
a pretty waterfall and by which means my walk would be shortened he
likewise procured for me a guide 

upon asking a neighbouring chief to recommend a man the chief himself
offered to go but his ignorance of the value of money was so complete 
that at first he asked how many pounds i would give him but afterwards
was well contented with two dollars when i showed the chief a very
small bundle which i wanted carried it became absolutely necessary
for him to take a slave these feelings of pride are beginning to wear
away but formerly a leading man would sooner have died than undergone
the indignity of carrying the smallest burden my companion was a
light active man dressed in a dirty blanket and with his face
completely tattooed he had formerly been a great warrior he
appeared to be on very cordial terms with mr bushby but at various
times they had quarrelled violently mr bushby remarked that a little
quiet irony would frequently silence any one of these natives in their
most blustering moments this chief has come and harangued mr bushby
in a hectoring manner saying great chief a great man a friend of
mine has come to pay me a visit you must give him something good to
eat some fine presents etc mr bushby has allowed him to finish his
discourse and then has quietly replied by some answer such as what
else shall your slave do for you the man would then instantly with a
very comical expression cease his braggadocio 

some time ago mr bushby suffered a far more serious attack a chief
and a party of men tried to break into his house in the middle of the
night and not finding this so easy commenced a brisk firing with
their muskets mr bushby was slightly wounded but the party was at
length driven away shortly afterwards it was discovered who was the
aggressor and a general meeting of the chiefs was convened to consider
the case it was considered by the new zealanders as very atrocious 
inasmuch as it was a night attack and that mrs bushby was lying ill
in the house this latter circumstance much to their honour being
considered in all cases as a protection the chiefs agreed to
confiscate the land of the aggressor to the king of england the whole
proceeding however in thus trying and punishing a chief was entirely
without precedent the aggressor moreover lost caste in the
estimation of his equals and this was considered by the british as of
more consequence than the confiscation of his land 

as the boat was shoving off a second chief stepped into her who only
wanted the amusement of the passage up and down the creek i never saw
a more horrid and ferocious expression than this man had it
immediately struck me i had somewhere seen his likeness it will be
found in retzch s outlines to schiller s ballad of fridolin where two
men are pushing robert into the burning iron furnace it is the man
who has his arm on robert s breast physiognomy here spoke the truth 
this chief had been a notorious murderer and was an arrant coward to
boot at the point where the boat landed mr bushby accompanied me a
few hundred yards on the road i could not help admiring the cool
impudence of the hoary old villain whom we left lying in the boat 
when he shouted to mr bushby do not you stay long i shall be tired
of waiting here 

we now commenced our walk the road lay along a well beaten path 
bordered on each side by the tall fern which covers the whole country 
after travelling some miles we came to a little country village where
a few hovels were collected together and some patches of ground
cultivated with potatoes the introduction of the potato has been the
most essential benefit to the island it is now much more used than any
native vegetable new zealand is favoured by one great natural
advantage namely that the inhabitants can never perish from famine 
the whole country abounds with fern and the roots of this plant if
not very palatable yet contain much nutriment a native can always
subsist on these and on the shell-fish which are abundant on all
parts of the sea-coast the villages are chiefly conspicuous by the
platforms which are raised on four posts ten or twelve feet above the
ground and on which the produce of the fields is kept secure from all
accidents 

on coming near one of the huts i was much amused by seeing in due form
the ceremony of rubbing or as it ought to be called pressing noses 
the women on our first approach began uttering something in a most
dolorous voice they then squatted themselves down and held up their
faces my companion standing over them one after another placed the
bridge of his nose at right angles to theirs and commenced pressing 
this lasted rather longer than a cordial shake of the hand with us and
as we vary the force of the grasp of the hand in shaking so do they in
pressing during the process they uttered comfortable little grunts 
very much in the same manner as two pigs do when rubbing against each
other i noticed that the slave would press noses with any one he met 
indifferently either before or after his master the chief although
among the savages the chief has absolute power of life and death over
his slave yet there is an entire absence of ceremony between them mr 
burchell has remarked the same thing in southern africa with the rude
bachapins where civilization has arrived at a certain point complex
formalities soon arise between the different grades of society thus at
tahiti all were formerly obliged to uncover themselves as low as the
waist in presence of the king 

the ceremony of pressing noses having been duly completed with all
present we seated ourselves in a circle in the front of one of the
hovels and rested there half-an-hour all the hovels have nearly the
same form and dimensions and all agree in being filthily dirty they
resemble a cow-shed with one end open but having a partition a little
way within with a square hole in it making a small gloomy chamber in
this the inhabitants keep all their property and when the weather is
cold they sleep there they eat however and pass their time in the
open part in front my guides having finished their pipes we
continued our walk the path led through the same undulating country 
the whole uniformly clothed as before with fern on our right hand we
had a serpentine river the banks of which were fringed with trees and
here and there on the hill sides there was a clump of wood the whole
scene in spite of its green colour had rather a desolate aspect the
sight of so much fern impresses the mind with an idea of sterility 
this however is not correct for wherever the fern grows thick and
breast-high the land by tillage becomes productive some of the
residents think that all this extensive open country originally was
covered with forests and that it has been cleared by fire it is said 
that by digging in the barest spots lumps of the kind of resin which
flows from the kauri pine are frequently found the natives had an
evident motive in clearing the country for the fern formerly a staple
article of food flourishes only in the open cleared tracks the
almost entire absence of associated grasses which forms so remarkable
a feature in the vegetation of this island may perhaps be accounted
for by the land having been aboriginally covered with forest-trees 

the soil is volcanic in several parts we passed over shaggy lavas and
craters could clearly be distinguished on several of the neighbouring
hills although the scenery is nowhere beautiful and only
occasionally pretty i enjoyed my walk i should have enjoyed it more 
if my companion the chief had not possessed extraordinary
conversational powers i knew only three words good bad and
 yes and with these i answered all his remarks without of course
having understood one word he said this however was quite
sufficient i was a good listener an agreeable person and he never
ceased talking to me 

at length we reached waimate after having passed over so many miles
of an uninhabited useless country the sudden appearance of an english
farm-house and its well-dressed fields placed there as if by an
enchanter s wand was exceedingly pleasant mr williams not being at
home i received in mr davies s house a cordial welcome after
drinking tea with his family party we took a stroll about the farm at
waimate there are three large houses where the missionary gentlemen 
messrs williams davies and clarke reside and near them are the
huts of the native labourers on an adjoining slope fine crops of
barley and wheat were standing in full ear and in another part fields
of potatoes and clover but i cannot attempt to describe all i saw 
there were large gardens with every fruit and vegetable which england
produces and many belonging to a warmer clime i may instance
asparagus kidney beans cucumbers rhubarb apples pears figs 
peaches apricots grapes olives gooseberries currants hops gorse
for fences and english oaks also many kinds of flowers around the
farm-yard there were stables a thrashing-barn with its winnowing
machine a blacksmith s forge and on the ground ploughshares and other
tools in the middle was that happy mixture of pigs and poultry lying
comfortably together as in every english farm-yard at the distance
of a few hundred yards where the water of a little rill had been
dammed up into a pool there was a large and substantial water-mill 

all this is very surprising when it is considered that five years ago
nothing but the fern flourished here moreover native workmanship 
taught by the missionaries has effected this change the lesson of
the missionary is the enchanter s wand the house had been built the
windows framed the fields ploughed and even the trees grafted by a
new zealander at the mill a new zealander was seen powdered white
with flower like his brother miller in england when i looked at this
whole scene i thought it admirable it was not merely that england
was brought vividly before my mind yet as the evening drew to a
close the domestic sounds the fields of corn the distant undulating
country with its trees might well have been mistaken for our
fatherland nor was it the triumphant feeling at seeing what englishmen
could effect but rather the high hopes thus inspired for the future
progress of this fine island 


several young men redeemed by the missionaries from slavery were
employed on the farm they were dressed in a shirt jacket and
trousers and had a respectable appearance judging from one trifling
anecdote i should think they must be honest when walking in the
fields a young labourer came up to mr davies and gave him a knife
and gimlet saying that he had found them on the road and did not know
to whom they belonged these young men and boys appeared very merry
and good-humoured in the evening i saw a party of them at cricket 
when i thought of the austerity of which the missionaries have been
accused i was amused by observing one of their own sons taking an
active part in the game a more decided and pleasing change was
manifested in the young women who acted as servants within the houses 
their clean tidy and healthy appearance like that of the dairy-maids
in england formed a wonderful contrast with the women of the filthy
hovels in kororadika the wives of the missionaries tried to persuade
them not to be tattooed but a famous operator having arrived from the
south they said we really must just have a few lines on our lips 
else when we grow old our lips will shrivel and we shall be so very
ugly there is not nearly so much tattooing as formerly but as it is
a badge of distinction between the chief and the slave it will
probably long be practised so soon does any train of ideas become
habitual that the missionaries told me that even in their eyes a plain
face looked mean and not like that of a new zealand gentleman 

late in the evening i went to mr williams s house where i passed the
night i found there a large party of children collected together for
christmas day and all sitting round a table at tea i never saw a
nicer or more merry group and to think that this was in the centre of
the land of cannibalism murder and all atrocious crimes the
cordiality and happiness so plainly pictured in the faces of the little
circle appeared equally felt by the older persons of the mission 

december th in the morning prayers were read in the native tongue
to the whole family after breakfast i rambled about the gardens and
farm this was a market-day when the natives of the surrounding
hamlets bring their potatoes indian corn or pigs to exchange for
blankets tobacco and sometimes through the persuasions of the
missionaries for soap mr davies s eldest son who manages a farm of
his own is the man of business in the market the children of the
missionaries who came while young to the island understand the
language better than their parents and can get anything more readily
done by the natives 

a little before noon messrs williams and davies walked with me to a
part of a neighbouring forest to show me the famous kauri pine i
measured one of the noble trees and found it thirty-one feet in
circumference above the roots there was another close by which i did
not see thirty-three feet and i heard of one no less than forty feet 
these trees are remarkable for their smooth cylindrical boles which
run up to a height of sixty and even ninety feet with a nearly equal
diameter and without a single branch the crown of branches at the
summit is out of all proportion small to the trunk and the leaves are
likewise small compared with the branches the forest was here almost
composed of the kauri and the largest trees from the parallelism of
their sides stood up like gigantic columns of wood the timber of the
kauri is the most valuable production of the island moreover a
quantity of resin oozes from the bark which is sold at a penny a pound
to the americans but its use was then unknown some of the new
zealand forest must be impenetrable to an extraordinary degree mr 
matthews informed me that one forest only thirty-four miles in width 
and separating two inhabited districts had only lately for the first
time been crossed he and another missionary each with a party of
about fifty men undertook to open a road but it cost more than a
fortnight s labour in the woods i saw very few birds with regard to
animals it is a most remarkable fact that so large an island 
extending over more than miles in latitude and in many parts
ninety broad with varied stations a fine climate and land of all
heights from feet downwards with the exception of a small rat 
did not possess one indigenous animal the several species of that
gigantic genus of birds the deinornis seem here to have replaced
mammiferous quadrupeds in the same manner as the reptiles still do at
the galapagos archipelago it is said that the common norway rat in
the short space of two years annihilated in this northern end of the
island the new zealand species in many places i noticed several
sorts of weeds which like the rats i was forced to own as
countrymen a leek has overrun whole districts and will prove very
troublesome but it was imported as a favour by a french vessel the
common dock is also widely disseminated and will i fear for ever
remain a proof of the rascality of an englishman who sold the seeds
for those of the tobacco plant 

on returning from our pleasant walk to the house i dined with mr 
williams and then a horse being lent me i returned to the bay of
islands i took leave of the missionaries with thankfulness for their
kind welcome and with feelings of high respect for their
gentlemanlike useful and upright characters i think it would be
difficult to find a body of men better adapted for the high office
which they fulfil 

christmas day in a few more days the fourth year of our absence from
england will be completed our first christmas day was spent at
plymouth the second at st martin s cove near cape horn the third at
port desire in patagonia the fourth at anchor in a wild harbour in
the peninsula of tres montes this fifth here and the next i trust in
providence will be in england we attended divine service in the
chapel of pahia part of the service being read in english and part in
the native language whilst at new zealand we did not hear of any
recent acts of cannibalism but mr stokes found burnt human bones
strewed round a fire-place on a small island near the anchorage but
these remains of a comfortable banquet might have been lying there for
several years it is probable that the moral state of the people will
rapidly improve mr bushby mentioned one pleasing anecdote as a proof
of the sincerity of some at least of those who profess christianity 
one of his young men left him who had been accustomed to read prayers
to the rest of the servants some weeks afterwards happening to pass
late in the evening by an outhouse he saw and heard one of his men
reading the bible with difficulty by the light of the fire to the
others after this the party knelt and prayed in their prayers they
mentioned mr bushby and his family and the missionaries each
separately in his respective district 

december th mr bushby offered to take mr sulivan and myself in
his boat some miles up the river to cawa-cawa and proposed afterwards
to walk on to the village of waiomio where there are some curious
rocks following one of the arms of the bay we enjoyed a pleasant
row and passed through pretty scenery until we came to a village 
beyond which the boat could not pass from this place a chief and a
party of men volunteered to walk with us to waiomio a distance of four
miles the chief was at this time rather notorious from having lately
hung one of his wives and a slave for adultery when one of the
missionaries remonstrated with him he seemed surprised and said he
thought he was exactly following the english method old shongi who
happened to be in england during the queen s trial expressed great
disapprobation at the whole proceeding he said he had five wives and
he would rather cut off all their heads than be so much troubled about
one leaving this village we crossed over to another seated on a
hill-side at a little distance the daughter of a chief who was still
a heathen had died there five days before the hovel in which she had
expired had been burnt to the ground her body being enclosed between
two small canoes was placed upright on the ground and protected by an
enclosure bearing wooden images of their gods and the whole was
painted bright red so as to be conspicuous from afar her gown was
fastened to the coffin and her hair being cut off was cast at its
foot the relatives of the family had torn the flesh of their arms 
bodies and faces so that they were covered with clotted blood and
the old women looked most filthy disgusting objects on the following
day some of the officers visited this place and found the women still
howling and cutting themselves 

we continued our walk and soon reached waiomio here there are some
singular masses of limestone resembling ruined castles these rocks
have long served for burial places and in consequence are held too
sacred to be approached one of the young men however cried out let
us all be brave and ran on ahead but when within a hundred yards 
the whole party thought better of it and stopped short with perfect
indifference however they allowed us to examine the whole place at
this village we rested some hours during which time there was a long
discussion with mr bushby concerning the right of sale of certain
lands one old man who appeared a perfect genealogist illustrated the
successive possessors by bits of stick driven into the ground before
leaving the houses a little basketful of roasted sweet potatoes was
given to each of our party and we all according to the custom 
carried them away to eat on the road i noticed that among the women
employed in cooking there was a man-slave it must be a humiliating
thing for a man in this warlike country to be employed in doing that
which is considered as the lowest woman s work slaves are not allowed
to go to war but this perhaps can hardly be considered as a hardship 
i heard of one poor wretch who during hostilities ran away to the
opposite party being met by two men he was immediately seized but as
they could not agree to whom he should belong each stood over him with
a stone hatchet and seemed determined that the other at least should
not take him away alive the poor man almost dead with fright was
only saved by the address of a chief s wife we afterwards enjoyed a
pleasant walk back to the boat but did not reach the ship till late in
the evening 

december th in the afternoon we stood out of the bay of islands on
our course to sydney i believe we were all glad to leave new zealand 
it is not a pleasant place amongst the natives there is absent that
charming simplicity which is found in tahiti and the greater part of
the english are the very refuse of society neither is the country
itself attractive i look back but to one bright spot and that is
waimate with its christian inhabitants

january th early in the morning a light air carried us
towards the entrance of port jackson instead of beholding a verdant
country interspersed with fine houses a straight line of yellowish
cliff brought to our minds the coast of patagonia a solitary
lighthouse built of white stone alone told us that we were near a
great and populous city having entered the harbour it appears fine
and spacious with cliff-formed shores of horizontally stratified
sandstone the nearly level country is covered with thin scrubby
trees bespeaking the curse of sterility proceeding further inland 
the country improves beautiful villas and nice cottages are here and
there scattered along the beach in the distance stone houses two and
three stories high and windmills standing on the edge of a bank 
pointed out to us the neighbourhood of the capital of australia 

at last we anchored within sydney cove we found the little basin
occupied by many large ships and surrounded by warehouses in the
evening i walked through the town and returned full of admiration at
the whole scene it is a most magnificent testimony to the power of
the british nation here in a less promising country scores of years
have done many more times more than an equal number of centuries have
effected in south america my first feeling was to congratulate myself
that i was born an englishman upon seeing more of the town
afterwards perhaps my admiration fell a little but yet it is a fine
town the streets are regular broad clean and kept in excellent
order the houses are of a good size and the shops well furnished it
may be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from
london and a few other great towns in england but not even near london
or birmingham is there an appearance of such rapid growth the number
of large houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising 
nevertheless every one complained of the high rents and difficulty in
procuring a house coming from south america where in the towns every
man of property is known no one thing surprised me more than not being
able to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged 

i hired a man and two horses to take me to bathurst a village about
one hundred and twenty miles in the interior and the centre of a great
pastoral district by this means i hoped to gain a general idea of the
appearance of the country on the morning of the th january i set
out on my excursion the first stage took us to paramatta a small
country town next to sydney in importance the roads were excellent 
and made upon the macadam principle whinstone having been brought for
the purpose from the distance of several miles in all respects there
was a close resemblance to england perhaps the alehouses here were
more numerous the iron gangs or parties of convicts who have
committed here some offense appeared the least like england they were
working in chains under the charge of sentries with loaded arms 

the power which the government possesses by means of forced labour of
at once opening good roads throughout the country has been i believe 
one main cause of the early prosperity of this colony i slept at
night at a very comfortable inn at emu ferry thirty-five miles from
sydney and near the ascent of the blue mountains this line of road
is the most frequented and has been the longest inhabited of any in
the colony the whole land is enclosed with high railings for the
farmers have not succeeded in rearing hedges there are many
substantial houses and good cottages scattered about but although
considerable pieces of land are under cultivation the greater part yet
remains as when first discovered 

the extreme uniformity of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature
in the landscape of the greater part of new south wales everywhere we
have an open woodland the ground being partially covered with a very
thin pasture with little appearance of verdure the trees nearly all
belong to one family and mostly have their leaves placed in a
vertical instead of as in europe in a nearly horizontal position the
foliage is scanty and of a peculiar pale green tint without any
gloss hence the woods appear light and shadowless this although a
loss of comfort to the traveller under the scorching rays of summer is
of importance to the farmer as it allows grass to grow where it
otherwise would not the leaves are not shed periodically this
character appears common to the entire southern hemisphere namely 
south america australia and the cape of good hope the inhabitants
of this hemisphere and of the intertropical regions thus lose perhaps
one of the most glorious though to our eyes common spectacles in the
world the first bursting into full foliage of the leafless tree they
may however say that we pay dearly for this by having the land
covered with mere naked skeletons for so many months this is too true
but our senses thus acquire a keen relish for the exquisite green of
the spring which the eyes of those living within the tropics sated
during the long year with the gorgeous productions of those glowing
climates can never experience the greater number of the trees with
the exception of some of the blue-gums do not attain a large size but
they grow tall and tolerably straight and stand well apart the bark
of some of the eucalypti falls annually or hangs dead in long shreds
which swing about with the wind and give to the woods a desolate and
untidy appearance i cannot imagine a more complete contrast in every
respect than between the forests of valdivia or chiloe and the woods
of australia 

at sunset a party of a score of the black aborigines passed by each
carrying in their accustomed manner a bundle of spears and other
weapons by giving a leading young man a shilling they were easily
detained and threw their spears for my amusement they were all
partly clothed and several could speak a little english their
countenances were good-humoured and pleasant and they appeared far
from being such utterly degraded beings as they have usually been
represented in their own arts they are admirable a cap being fixed
at thirty yards distance they transfixed it with a spear delivered by
the throwing-stick with the rapidity of an arrow from the bow of a
practised archer in tracking animals or men they show most wonderful
sagacity and i heard of several of their remarks which manifested
considerable acuteness they will not however cultivate the ground 
or build houses and remain stationary or even take the trouble of
tending a flock of sheep when given to them on the whole they appear
to me to stand some few degrees higher in the scale of civilization
than the fuegians 

it is very curious thus to see in the midst of a civilized people a
set of harmless savages wandering about without knowing where they
shall sleep at night and gaining their livelihood by hunting in the
woods as the white man has travelled onwards he has spread over the
country belonging to several tribes these although thus enclosed by
one common people keep up their ancient distinctions and sometimes go
to war with each other in an engagement which took place lately the
two parties most singularly chose the centre of the village of bathurst
for the field of battle this was of service to the defeated side for
the runaway warriors took refuge in the barracks 

the number of aborigines is rapidly decreasing in my whole ride with
the exception of some boys brought up by englishmen i saw only one
other party this decrease no doubt must be partly owing to the
introduction of spirits to european diseases even the milder ones of
which such as the measles prove very destructive and to the
gradual extinction of the wild animals it is said that numbers of
their children invariably perish in very early infancy from the effects
of their wandering life and as the difficulty of procuring food
increases so must their wandering habits increase and hence the
population without any apparent deaths from famine is repressed in a
manner extremely sudden compared to what happens in civilized
countries where the father though in adding to his labour he may
injure himself does not destroy his offspring 

besides the several evident causes of destruction there appears to be
some more mysterious agency generally at work wherever the european
has trod death seems to pursue the aboriginal we may look to the
wide extent of the americas polynesia the cape of good hope and
australia and we find the same result nor is it the white man alone
that thus acts the destroyer the polynesian of malay extraction has in
parts of the east indian archipelago thus driven before him the
dark-coloured native the varieties of man seem to act on each other
in the same way as different species of animals the stronger always
extirpating the weaker it was melancholy at new zealand to hear the
fine energetic natives saying that they knew the land was doomed to
pass from their children every one has heard of the inexplicable
reduction of the population in the beautiful and healthy island of
tahiti since the date of captain cook s voyages although in that case
we might have expected that it would have been increased for
infanticide which formerly prevailed to so extraordinary a degree has
ceased profligacy has greatly diminished and the murderous wars
become less frequent 

the rev j williams in his interesting work says that the first
intercourse between natives and europeans is invariably attended with
the introduction of fever dysentery or some other disease which
carries off numbers of the people again he affirms it is certainly
a fact which cannot be controverted that most of the diseases which
have raged in the islands during my residence there have been
introduced by ships and what renders this fact remarkable is that
there might be no appearance of disease among the crew of the ship
which conveyed this destructive importation this statement is not
quite so extraordinary as it at first appears for several cases are on
record of the most malignant fevers having broken out although the
parties themselves who were the cause were not affected in the
early part of the reign of george iii a prisoner who had been
confined in a dungeon was taken in a coach with four constables before
a magistrate and although the man himself was not ill the four
constables died from a short putrid fever but the contagion extended
to no others from these facts it would almost appear as if the
effluvium of one set of men shut up for some time together was
poisonous when inhaled by others and possibly more so if the men be
of different races mysterious as this circumstance appears to be it
is not more surprising than that the body of one s fellow-creature 
directly after death and before putrefaction has commenced should
often be of so deleterious a quality that the mere puncture from an
instrument used in its dissection should prove fatal 

th early in the morning we passed the nepean in a ferry-boat the
river although at this spot both broad and deep had a very small body
of running water having crossed a low piece of land on the opposite
side we reached the slope of the blue mountains the ascent is not
steep the road having been cut with much care on the side of a
sandstone cliff on the summit an almost level plain extends which 
rising imperceptibly to the westward at last attains a height of more
than feet from so grand a title as blue mountains and from
their absolute altitude i expected to have seen a bold chain of
mountains crossing the country but instead of this a sloping plain
presents merely an inconsiderable front to the low land near the coast 
from this first slope the view of the extensive woodland to the east
was striking and the surrounding trees grew bold and lofty but when
once on the sandstone platform the scenery becomes exceedingly
monotonous each side of the road is bordered by scrubby trees of the
never-failing eucalyptus family and with the exception of two or three
small inns there are no houses or cultivated land the road moreover 
is solitary the most frequent object being a bullock-waggon piled up
with bales of wool 

in the middle of the day we baited our horses at a little inn called
the weatherboard the country here is elevated feet above the
sea about a mile and a half from this place there is a view
exceedingly well worth visiting following down a little valley and
its tiny rill of water an immense gulf unexpectedly opens through the
trees which border the pathway at the depth of perhaps feet 
walking on a few yards one stands on the brink of a vast precipice 
and below one sees a grand bay or gulf for i know not what other name
to give it thickly covered with forest the point of view is situated
as if at the head of a bay the line of cliff diverging on each side 
and showing headland behind headland as on a bold sea-coast these
cliffs are composed of horizontal strata of whitish sandstone and are
so absolutely vertical that in many places a person standing on the
edge and throwing down a stone can see it strike the trees in the
abyss below so unbroken is the line of cliff that in order to reach
the foot of the waterfall formed by this little stream it is said to
be necessary to go sixteen miles round about five miles distant in
front another line of cliff extends which thus appears completely to
encircle the valley and hence the name of bay is justified as applied
to this grand amphitheatrical depression if we imagine a winding
harbour with its deep water surrounded by bold cliff-like shores to
be laid dry and a forest to spring up on its sandy bottom we should
then have the appearance and structure here exhibited this kind of
view was to me quite novel and extremely magnificent 

in the evening we reached the blackheath the sandstone plateau has
here attained the height of feet and is covered as before with
the same scrubby woods from the road there were occasional glimpses
into a profound valley of the same character as the one described but
from the steepness and depth of its sides the bottom was scarcely ever
to be seen the blackheath is a very comfortable inn kept by an old
soldier and it reminded me of the small inns in north wales 

th very early in the morning i walked about three miles to see
govett s leap a view of a similar character with that near the
weatherboard but perhaps even more stupendous so early in the day
the gulf was filled with a thin blue haze which although destroying
the general effect of the view added to the apparent depth at which the
forest was stretched out beneath our feet these valleys which so
long presented an insuperable barrier to the attempts of the most
enterprising of the colonists to reach the interior are most
remarkable great arm-like bays expanding at their upper ends often
branch from the main valleys and penetrate the sandstone platform on
the other hand the platform often sends promontories into the valleys 
and even leaves in them great almost insulated masses to descend
into some of these valleys it is necessary to go round twenty miles 
and into others the surveyors have only lately penetrated and the
colonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle but the
most remarkable feature in their structure is that although several
miles wide at their heads they generally contract towards their mouths
to such a degree as to become impassable the surveyor-general sir t 
mitchell endeavoured in vain first walking and then by crawling
between the great fallen fragments of sandstone to ascend through the
gorge by which the river grose joins the nepean yet the valley of the
grose in its upper part as i saw forms a magnificent level basin some
miles in width and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs the summits
of which are believed to be nowhere less than feet above the level
of the sea when cattle are driven into the valley of the wolgan by a
path which i descended partly natural and partly made by the owner
of the land they cannot escape for this valley is in every other part
surrounded by perpendicular cliffs and eight miles lower down it
contracts from an average width of half a mile to a mere chasm 
impassable to man or beast sir t mitchell states that the great
valley of the cox river with all its branches contracts where it
unites with the nepean into a gorge yards in width and about
 feet in depth other similar cases might have been added 

the first impression on seeing the correspondence of the horizontal
strata on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatrical
depressions is that they have been hollowed out like other valleys 
by the action of water but when one reflects on the enormous amount of
stone which on this view must have been removed through mere gorges or
chasms one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have subsided 
but considering the form of the irregularly branching valleys and of
the narrow promontories projecting into them from the platforms we are
compelled to abandon this notion to attribute these hollows to the
present alluvial action would be preposterous nor does the drainage
from the summit-level always fall as i remarked near the weatherboard 
into the head of these valleys but into one side of their bay-like
recesses some of the inhabitants remarked to me that they never
viewed one of those bay-like recesses with the headlands receding on
both hands without being struck with their resemblance to a bold
sea-coast this is certainly the case moreover on the present coast
of new south wales the numerous fine widely-branching harbours 
which are generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth worn
through the sandstone coast-cliffs varying from one mile in width to a
quarter of a mile present a likeness though on a miniature scale to
the great valleys of the interior but then immediately occurs the
startling difficulty why has the sea worn out these great though
circumscribed depressions on a wide platform and left mere gorges at
the openings through which the whole vast amount of triturated matter
must have been carried away the only light i can throw upon this
enigma is by remarking that banks of the most irregular forms appear
to be now forming in some seas as in parts of the west indies and in
the red sea and that their sides are exceedingly steep such banks i
have been led to suppose have been formed by sediment heaped by strong
currents on an irregular bottom that in some cases the sea instead
of spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet heaps it round submarine
rocks and islands it is hardly possible to doubt after examining the
charts of the west indies and that the waves have power to form high
and precipitous cliffs even in land-locked harbours i have noticed in
many parts of south america to apply these ideas to the sandstone
platforms of new south wales i imagine that the strata were heaped by
the action of strong currents and of the undulations of an open sea 
on an irregular bottom and that the valley-like spaces thus left
unfilled had their steeply sloping flanks worn into cliffs during a
slow elevation of the land the worn-down sandstone being removed 
either at the time when the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating
sea or subsequently by alluvial action 


soon after leaving the blackheath we descended from the sandstone
platform by the pass of mount victoria to effect this pass an
enormous quantity of stone has been cut through the design and its
manner of execution being worthy of any line of road in england we
now entered upon a country less elevated by nearly a thousand feet and
consisting of granite with the change of rock the vegetation
improved the trees were both finer and stood farther apart and the
pasture between them was a little greener and more plentiful at
hassan s walls i left the high road and made a short detour to a farm
called walerawang to the superintendent of which i had a letter of
introduction from the owner in sydney mr browne had the kindness to
ask me to stay the ensuing day which i had much pleasure in doing 
this place offers an example of one of the large farming or rather
sheep-grazing establishments of the colony cattle and horses are 
however in this case rather more numerous than usual owing to some of
the valleys being swampy and producing a coarser pasture two or three
flat pieces of ground near the house were cleared and cultivated with
corn which the harvest-men were now reaping but no more wheat is sown
than sufficient for the annual support of the labourers employed on the
establishment the usual number of assigned convict-servants here is
about forty but at the present time there were rather more although
the farm was well stocked with every necessary there was an apparent
absence of comfort and not one single woman resided here the sunset
of a fine day will generally cast an air of happy contentment on any
scene but here at this retired farm-house the brightest tints on the
surrounding woods could not make me forget that forty hardened 
profligate men were ceasing from their daily labours like the slaves
from africa yet without their holy claim for compassion 

early on the next morning mr archer the joint superintendent had
the kindness to take me out kangaroo-hunting we continued riding the
greater part of the day but had very bad sport not seeing a kangaroo 
or even a wild dog the greyhounds pursued a kangaroo rat into a hollow
tree out of which we dragged it it is an animal as large as a rabbit 
but with the figure of a kangaroo a few years since this country
abounded with wild animals but now the emu is banished to a long
distance and the kangaroo is become scarce to both the english
greyhound has been highly destructive it may be long before these
animals are altogether exterminated but their doom is fixed the
aborigines are always anxious to borrow the dogs from the farm-houses 
the use of them the offal when an animal is killed and some milk from
the cows are the peace-offerings of the settlers who push farther and
farther towards the interior the thoughtless aboriginal blinded by
these trifling advantages is delighted at the approach of the white
man who seems predestined to inherit the country of his children 

although having poor sport we enjoyed a pleasant ride the woodland is
generally so open that a person on horseback can gallop through it it
is traversed by a few flat-bottomed valleys which are green and free
from trees in such spots the scenery was pretty like that of a park 
in the whole country i scarcely saw a place without the marks of a
fire whether these had been more or less recent whether the stumps
were more or less black was the greatest change which varied the
uniformity so wearisome to the traveller s eye in these woods there
are not many birds i saw however some large flocks of the white
cockatoo feeding in a corn-field and a few most beautiful parrots 
crows like our jackdaws were not uncommon and another bird something
like the magpie in the dusk of the evening i took a stroll along a
chain of ponds which in this dry country represented the course of a
river and had the good fortune to see several of the famous
ornithorhynchus paradoxus they were diving and playing about the
surface of the water but showed so little of their bodies that they
might easily have been mistaken for water-rats mr browne shot one 
certainly it is a most extraordinary animal a stuffed specimen does
not at all give a good idea of the appearance of the head and beak when
fresh the latter becoming hard and contracted 

th a long day s ride to bathurst before joining the highroad we
followed a mere path through the forest and the country with the
exception of a few squatters huts was very solitary we experienced
this day the sirocco-like wind of australia which comes from the
parched deserts of the interior clouds of dust were travelling in
every direction and the wind felt as if it had passed over a fire i
afterwards heard that the thermometer out of doors had stood at 
degs and in a closed room at degs in the afternoon we came in
view of the downs of bathurst these undulating but nearly smooth
plains are very remarkable in this country from being absolutely
destitute of trees they support only a thin brown pasture we rode
some miles over this country and then reached the township of
bathurst seated in the middle of what may be called either a very
broad valley or narrow plain i was told at sydney not to form too
bad an opinion of australia by judging of the country from the
roadside nor too good a one from bathurst in this latter respect i
did not feel myself in the least danger of being prejudiced the
season it must be owned had been one of great drought and the
country did not wear a favourable aspect although i understand it was
incomparably worse two or three months before the secret of the
rapidly growing prosperity of bathurst is that the brown pasture which
appears to the stranger s eye so wretched is excellent for
sheep-grazing the town stands at the height of feet above the
sea on the banks of the macquarie this is one of the rivers flowing
into the vast and scarcely known interior the line of water-shed 
which divides the inland streams from those on the coast has a height
of about feet and runs in a north and south direction at the
distance of from eighty to a hundred miles from the sea-side the
macquarie figures in the map as a respectable river and it is the
largest of those draining this part of the water-shed yet to my
surprise i found it a mere chain of ponds separated from each other by
spaces almost dry generally a small stream is running and sometimes
there are high and impetuous floods scanty as the supply of the water
is throughout this district it becomes still scantier further inland 

nd i commenced my return and followed a new road called lockyer s
line along which the country is rather more hilly and picturesque 
this was a long day s ride and the house where i wished to sleep was
some way off the road and not easily found i met on this occasion 
and indeed on all others a very general and ready civility among the
lower orders which when one considers what they are and what they
have been would scarcely have been expected the farm where i passed
the night was owned by two young men who had only lately come out and
were beginning a settler s life the total want of almost every
comfort was not attractive but future and certain prosperity was
before their eyes and that not far distant 

the next day we passed through large tracts of country in flames 
volumes of smoke sweeping across the road before noon we joined our
former road and ascended mount victoria i slept at the weatherboard 
and before dark took another walk to the amphitheatre on the road to
sydney i spent a very pleasant evening with captain king at dunheved 
and thus ended my little excursion in the colony of new south wales 

before arriving here the three things which interested me most
were the state of society amongst the higher classes the condition of
the convicts and the degree of attraction sufficient to induce persons
to emigrate of course after so very short a visit one s opinion is
worth scarcely anything but it is as difficult not to form some
opinion as it is to form a correct judgment on the whole from what
i heard more than from what i saw i was disappointed in the state of
society the whole community is rancorously divided into parties on
almost every subject among those who from their station in life 
ought to be the best many live in such open profligacy that
respectable people cannot associate with them there is much jealousy
between the children of the rich emancipist and the free settlers the
former being pleased to consider honest men as interlopers the whole
population poor and rich are bent on acquiring wealth amongst the
higher orders wool and sheep-grazing form the constant subject of
conversation there are many serious drawbacks to the comforts of a
family the chief of which perhaps is being surrounded by convict
servants how thoroughly odious to every feeling to be waited on by a
man who the day before perhaps was flogged from your representation 
for some trifling misdemeanor the female servants are of course much
worse hence children learn the vilest expressions and it is
fortunate if not equally vile ideas 

on the other hand the capital of a person without any trouble on his
part produces him treble interest to what it will in england and with
care he is sure to grow rich the luxuries of life are in abundance 
and very little dearer than in england and most articles of food are
cheaper the climate is splendid and perfectly healthy but to my
mind its charms are lost by the uninviting aspect of the country 
settlers possess a great advantage in finding their sons of service
when very young at the age of from sixteen to twenty they frequently
take charge of distant farming stations this however must happen at
the expense of their boys associating entirely with convict servants i
am not aware that the tone of society has assumed any peculiar
character but with such habits and without intellectual pursuits it
can hardly fail to deteriorate my opinion is such that nothing but
rather sharp necessity should compel me to emigrate 

the rapid prosperity and future prospects of this colony are to me not
understanding these subjects very puzzling the two main exports are
wool and whale-oil and to both of these productions there is a limit 
the country is totally unfit for canals therefore there is a not very
distant point beyond which the land-carriage of wool will not repay
the expense of shearing and tending sheep pasture everywhere is so
thin that settlers have already pushed far into the interior moreover 
the country further inland becomes extremely poor agriculture on
account of the droughts can never succeed on an extended scale 
therefore so far as i can see australia must ultimately depend upon
being the centre of commerce for the southern hemisphere and perhaps
on her future manufactories possessing coal she always has the
moving power at hand from the habitable country extending along the
coast and from her english extraction she is sure to be a maritime
nation i formerly imagined that australia would rise to be as grand
and powerful a country as north america but now it appears to me that
such future grandeur is rather problematical 

with respect to the state of the convicts i had still fewer
opportunities of judging than on other points the first question is 
whether their condition is at all one of punishment no one will
maintain that it is a very severe one this however i suppose is of
little consequence as long as it continues to be an object of dread to
criminals at home the corporeal wants of the convicts are tolerably
well supplied their prospect of future liberty and comfort is not
distant and after good conduct certain a ticket of leave which 
as long as a man keeps clear of suspicion as well as of crime makes
him free within a certain district is given upon good conduct after
years proportional to the length of the sentence yet with all this 
and overlooking the previous imprisonment and wretched passage out i
believe the years of assignment are passed away with discontent and
unhappiness as an intelligent man remarked to me the convicts know
no pleasure beyond sensuality and in this they are not gratified the
enormous bribe which government possesses in offering free pardons 
together with the deep horror of the secluded penal settlements 
destroys confidence between the convicts and so prevents crime as to
a sense of shame such a feeling does not appear to be known and of
this i witnessed some very singular proofs though it is a curious
fact i was universally told that the character of the convict
population is one of arrant cowardice not unfrequently some become
desperate and quite indifferent as to life yet a plan requiring cool
or continued courage is seldom put into execution the worst feature
in the whole case is that although there exists what may be called a
legal reform and comparatively little is committed which the law can
touch yet that any moral reform should take place appears to be quite
out of the question i was assured by well-informed people that a man
who should try to improve could not while living with other assigned
servants his life would be one of intolerable misery and persecution 
nor must the contamination of the convict-ships and prisons both here
and in england be forgotten on the whole as a place of punishment 
the object is scarcely gained as a real system of reform it has
failed as perhaps would every other plan but as a means of making men
outwardly honest of converting vagabonds most useless in one
hemisphere into active citizens of another and thus giving birth to a
new and splendid country a grand centre of civilization it has
succeeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in history 


th the beagle sailed for hobart town in van diemen s land on the
th of february after a six days passage of which the first part was
fine and the latter very cold and squally we entered the mouth of
storm bay the weather justified this awful name the bay should
rather be called an estuary for it receives at its head the waters of
the derwent near the mouth there are some extensive basaltic
platforms but higher up the land becomes mountainous and is covered
by a light wood the lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are
cleared and the bright yellow fields of corn and dark green ones of
potatoes appear very luxuriant late in the evening we anchored in the
snug cove on the shores of which stands the capital of tasmania the
first aspect of the place was very inferior to that of sydney the
latter might be called a city this is only a town it stands at the
base of mount wellington a mountain feet high but of little
picturesque beauty from this source however it receives a good
supply of water round the cove there are some fine warehouses and on
one side a small fort coming from the spanish settlements where such
magnificent care has generally been paid to the fortifications the
means of defence in these colonies appeared very contemptible 
comparing the town with sydney i was chiefly struck with the
comparative fewness of the large houses either built or building 
hobart town from the census of contained inhabitants and
the whole of tasmania 

all the aborigines have been removed to an island in bass s straits so
that van diemen s land enjoys the great advantage of being free from a
native population this most cruel step seems to have been quite
unavoidable as the only means of stopping a fearful succession of
robberies burnings and murders committed by the blacks and which
sooner or later would have ended in their utter destruction i fear
there is no doubt that this train of evil and its consequences 
originated in the infamous conduct of some of our countrymen thirty
years is a short period in which to have banished the last aboriginal
from his native island and that island nearly as large as ireland 
the correspondence on this subject which took place between the
government at home and that of van diemen s land is very interesting 
although numbers of natives were shot and taken prisoners in the
skirmishing which was going on at intervals for several years nothing
seems fully to have impressed them with the idea of our overwhelming
power until the whole island in was put under martial law and
by proclamation the whole population commanded to assist in one great
attempt to secure the entire race the plan adopted was nearly similar
to that of the great hunting-matches in india a line was formed
reaching across the island with the intention of driving the natives
into a cul-de-sac on tasman s peninsula the attempt failed the
natives having tied up their dogs stole during one night through the
lines this is far from surprising when their practised senses and
usual manner of crawling after wild animals is considered i have been
assured that they can conceal themselves on almost bare ground in a
manner which until witnessed is scarcely credible their dusky bodies
being easily mistaken for the blackened stumps which are scattered all
over the country i was told of a trial between a party of englishmen
and a native who was to stand in full view on the side of a bare hill 
if the englishmen closed their eyes for less than a minute he would
squat down and then they were never able to distinguish him from the
surrounding stumps but to return to the hunting-match the natives
understanding this kind of warfare were terribly alarmed for they at
once perceived the power and numbers of the whites shortly afterwards
a party of thirteen belonging to two tribes came in and conscious of
their unprotected condition delivered themselves up in despair 
subsequently by the intrepid exertions of mr robinson an active and
benevolent man who fearlessly visited by himself the most hostile of
the natives the whole were induced to act in a similar manner they
were then removed to an island where food and clothes were provided
them count strzelecki states that at the epoch of their
deportation in the number of natives amounted to in 
that is after the interval of seven years they mustered only
fifty-four individuals and while each family of the interior of new
south wales uncontaminated by contact with the whites swarms with
children those of flinders island had during eight years an accession
of only fourteen in number 

the beagle stayed here ten days and in this time i made several
pleasant little excursions chiefly with the object of examining the
geological structure of the immediate neighbourhood the main points
of interest consist first in some highly fossiliferous strata 
belonging to the devonian or carboniferous period secondly in proofs
of a late small rise of the land and lastly in a solitary and
superficial patch of yellowish limestone or travertin which contains
numerous impressions of leaves of trees together with land-shells not
now existing it is not improbable that this one small quarry includes
the only remaining record of the vegetation of van diemen s land during
one former epoch 

the climate here is damper than in new south wales and hence the land
is more fertile agriculture flourishes the cultivated fields look
well and the gardens abound with thriving vegetables and fruit-trees 
some of the farm-houses situated in retired spots had a very
attractive appearance the general aspect of the vegetation is similar
to that of australia perhaps it is a little more green and cheerful 
and the pasture between the trees rather more abundant one day i took
a long walk on the side of the bay opposite to the town i crossed in a
steam-boat two of which are constantly plying backwards and forwards 
the machinery of one of these vessels was entirely manufactured in this
colony which from its very foundation then numbered only three and
thirty years another day i ascended mount wellington i took with me
a guide for i failed in a first attempt from the thickness of the
wood our guide however was a stupid fellow and conducted us to the
southern and damp side of the mountain where the vegetation was very
luxuriant and where the labour of the ascent from the number of
rotten trunks was almost as great as on a mountain in tierra del fuego
or in chiloe it cost us five and a half hours of hard climbing before
we reached the summit in many parts the eucalypti grew to a great
size and composed a noble forest in some of the dampest ravines 
tree-ferns flourished in an extraordinary manner i saw one which must
have been at least twenty feet high to the base of the fronds and was
in girth exactly six feet the fronds forming the most elegant
parasols produced a gloomy shade like that of the first hour of the
night the summit of the mountain is broad and flat and is composed
of huge angular masses of naked greenstone its elevation is feet
above the level of the sea the day was splendidly clear and we
enjoyed a most extensive view to the north the country appeared a
mass of wooded mountains of about the same height with that on which
we were standing and with an equally tame outline to the south the
broken land and water forming many intricate bays was mapped with
clearness before us after staying some hours on the summit we found
a better way to descend but did not reach the beagle till eight
o clock after a severe day s work 

february th the beagle sailed from tasmania and on the th of the
ensuing month reached king george s sound situated close to the s w 
corner of australia we stayed there eight days and we did not during
our voyage pass a more dull and uninteresting time the country 
viewed from an eminence appears a woody plain with here and there
rounded and partly bare hills of granite protruding one day i went out
with a party in hopes of seeing a kangaroo hunt and walked over a
good many miles of country everywhere we found the soil sandy and
very poor it supported either a coarse vegetation of thin low
brushwood and wiry grass or a forest of stunted trees the scenery
resembled that of the high sandstone platform of the blue mountains 
the casuarina a tree somewhat resembling a scotch fir is however 
here in greater number and the eucalyptus in rather less in the open
parts there were many grass-trees a plant which in appearance has
some affinity with the palm but instead of being surmounted by a
crown of noble fronds it can boast merely of a tuft of very coarse
grass-like leaves the general bright green colour of the brushwood
and other plants viewed from a distance seemed to promise fertility 
a single walk however was enough to dispel such an illusion and he
who thinks with me will never wish to walk again in so uninviting a
country 

one day i accompanied captain fitz roy to bald head the place
mentioned by so many navigators where some imagined that they saw
corals and others that they saw petrified trees standing in the
position in which they had grown according to our view the beds have
been formed by the wind having heaped up fine sand composed of minute
rounded particles of shells and corals during which process branches
and roots of trees together with many land-shells became enclosed 
the whole then became consolidated by the percolation of calcareous
matter and the cylindrical cavities left by the decaying of the wood 
were thus also filled up with a hard pseudo-stalactical stone the
weather is now wearing away the softer parts and in consequence the
hard casts of the roots and branches of the trees project above the
surface and in a singularly deceptive manner resemble the stumps of
a dead thicket 

a large tribe of natives called the white cockatoo men happened to pay
the settlement a visit while we were there these men as well as those
of the tribe belonging to king george s sound being tempted by the
offer of some tubs of rice and sugar were persuaded to hold a
 corrobery or great dancing-party as soon as it grew dark small
fires were lighted and the men commenced their toilet which consisted
in painting themselves white in spots and lines as soon as all was
ready large fires were kept blazing round which the women and
children were collected as spectators the cockatoo and king george s
men formed two distinct parties and generally danced in answer to each
other the dancing consisted in their running either sideways or in
indian file into an open space and stamping the ground with great
force as they marched together their heavy footsteps were accompanied
by a kind of grunt by beating their clubs and spears together and by
various other gesticulations such as extending their arms and
wriggling their bodies it was a most rude barbarous scene and to
our ideas without any sort of meaning but we observed that the black
women and children watched it with the greatest pleasure perhaps
these dances originally represented actions such as wars and
victories there was one called the emu dance in which each man
extended his arm in a bent manner like the neck of that bird in
another dance one man imitated the movements of a kangaroo grazing in
the woods whilst a second crawled up and pretended to spear him when
both tribes mingled in the dance the ground trembled with the
heaviness of their steps and the air resounded with their wild cries 
every one appeared in high spirits and the group of nearly naked
figures viewed by the light of the blazing fires all moving in
hideous harmony formed a perfect display of a festival amongst the
lowest barbarians in tierra del fuego we have beheld many curious
scenes in savage life but never i think one where the natives were
in such high spirits and so perfectly at their ease after the
dancing was over the whole party formed a great circle on the ground 
and the boiled rice and sugar was distributed to the delight of all 

after several tedious delays from clouded weather on the th of
march we gladly stood out of king george s sound on our course to
keeling island farewell australia you are a rising child and
doubtless some day will reign a great princess in the south but you
are too great and ambitious for affection yet not great enough for
respect i leave your shores without sorrow or regret 

 it is remarkable how the same disease is modified in different

keeling island coral formations

keeling island singular appearance scanty flora transport of
seeds birds and insects ebbing and flowing springs fields of dead
coral stones transported in the roots of trees great crab stinging
corals coral eating fish coral formations lagoon islands or
atolls depth at which reef-building corals can live vast areas
interspersed with low coral islands subsidence of their
foundations barrier reefs fringing reefs conversion of fringing
reefs into barrier reefs and into atolls evidence of changes in
level breaches in barrier reefs maldiva atolls their peculiar
structure dead and submerged reefs areas of subsidence and
elevation distribution of volcanoes subsidence slow and vast in
amount 


april st we arrived in view of the keeling or cocos islands 
situated in the indian ocean and about six hundred miles distant from
the coast of sumatra this is one of the lagoon-islands or atolls of
coral formation similar to those in the low archipelago which we
passed near when the ship was in the channel at the entrance mr 
liesk an english resident came off in his boat the history of the
inhabitants of this place in as few words as possible is as follows 
about nine years ago mr hare a worthless character brought from the
east indian archipelago a number of malay slaves which now including
children amount to more than a hundred shortly afterwards captain
ross who had before visited these islands in his merchant-ship 
arrived from england bringing with him his family and goods for
settlement along with him came mr liesk who had been a mate in his
vessel the malay slaves soon ran away from the islet on which mr hare
was settled and joined captain ross s party mr hare upon this was
ultimately obliged to leave the place 

the malays are now nominally in a state of freedom and certainly are
so as far as regards their personal treatment but in most other
points they are considered as slaves from their discontented state 
from the repeated removals from islet to islet and perhaps also from a
little mismanagement things are not very prosperous the island has
no domestic quadruped excepting the pig and the main vegetable
production is the cocoa-nut the whole prosperity of the place depends
on this tree the only exports being oil from the nut and the nuts
themselves which are taken to singapore and mauritius where they are
chiefly used when grated in making curries on the cocoa-nut also 
the pigs which are loaded with fat almost entirely subsist as do the
ducks and poultry even a huge land-crab is furnished by nature with
the means to open and feed on this most useful production 

the ring-formed reef of the lagoon-island is surmounted in the greater
part of its length by linear islets on the northern or leeward side 
there is an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage
within on entering the scene was very curious and rather pretty its
beauty however entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding
colours the shallow clear and still water of the lagoon resting in
its greater part on white sand is when illumined by a vertical sun 
of the most vivid green this brilliant expanse several miles in
width is on all sides divided either by a line of snow-white breakers
from the dark heaving waters of the ocean or from the blue vault of
heaven by the strips of land crowned by the level tops of the
cocoa-nut trees as a white cloud here and there affords a pleasing
contrast with the azure sky so in the lagoon bands of living coral
darken the emerald green water 

the next morning after anchoring i went on shore on direction island 
the strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards in width on the
lagoon side there is a white calcareous beach the radiation from which
under this sultry climate was very oppressive and on the outer coast 
a solid broad flat of coral-rock served to break the violence of the
open sea excepting near the lagoon where there is some sand the
land is entirely composed of rounded fragments of coral in such a
loose dry stony soil the climate of the intertropical regions alone
could produce a vigorous vegetation on some of the smaller islets 
nothing could be more elegant than the manner in which the young and
full-grown cocoa-nut trees without destroying each other s symmetry 
were mingled into one wood a beach of glittering white sand formed a
border to these fairy spots 

i will now give a sketch of the natural history of these islands 
which from its very paucity possesses a peculiar interest the
cocoa-nut tree at first glance seems to compose the whole wood there
are however five or six other trees one of these grows to a very
large size but from the extremes of softness of its wood is useless 
another sort affords excellent timber for ship-building besides the
trees the number of plants is exceedingly limited and consists of
insignificant weeds in my collection which includes i believe 
nearly the perfect flora there are twenty species without reckoning a
moss lichen and fungus to this number two trees must be added one
of which was not in flower and the other i only heard of the latter
is a solitary tree of its kind and grows near the beach where 
without doubt the one seed was thrown up by the waves a guilandina
also grows on only one of the islets i do not include in the above
list the sugar-cane banana some other vegetables fruit-trees and
imported grasses as the islands consist entirely of coral and at one
time must have existed as mere water-washed reefs all their
terrestrial productions must have been transported here by the waves of
the sea in accordance with this the florula has quite the character
of a refuge for the destitute professor henslow informs me that of the
twenty species nineteen belong to different genera and these again to
no less than sixteen families 

in holman s travels an account is given on the authority of mr a 
s keating who resided twelve months on these islands of the various
seeds and other bodies which have been known to have been washed on
shore seeds and plants from sumatra and java have been driven up by
the surf on the windward side of the islands among them have been
found the kimiri native of sumatra and the peninsula of malacca the
cocoa-nut of balci known by its shape and size the dadass which is
planted by the malays with the pepper-vine the latter intwining round
its trunk and supporting itself by the prickles on its stem the
soap-tree the castor-oil plant trunks of the sago palm and various
kinds of seeds unknown to the malays settled on the islands these are
all supposed to have been driven by the n w monsoon to the coast of
new holland and thence to these islands by the s e trade-wind large
masses of java teak and yellow wood have also been found besides
immense trees of red and white cedar and the blue gumwood of new
holland in a perfectly sound condition all the hardy seeds such as
creepers retain their germinating power but the softer kinds among
which is the mangostin are destroyed in the passage fishing-canoes 
apparently from java have at times been washed on shore it is
interesting thus to discover how numerous the seeds are which coming
from several countries are drifted over the wide ocean professor
henslow tells me he believes that nearly all the plants which i
brought from these islands are common littoral species in the east
indian archipelago from the direction however of the winds and
currents it seems scarcely possible that they could have come here in
a direct line if as suggested with much probability by mr keating 
they were first carried towards the coast of new holland and thence
drifted back together with the productions of that country the seeds 
before germinating must have travelled between and miles 

chamisso when describing the radack archipelago situated in the
western part of the pacific states that the sea brings to these
islands the seeds and fruits of many trees most of which have yet not
grown here the greater part of these seeds appear to have not yet
lost the capability of growing 

it is also said that palms and bamboos from somewhere in the torrid
zone and trunks of northern firs are washed on shore these firs must
have come from an immense distance these facts are highly
interesting it cannot be doubted that if there were land-birds to
pick up the seeds when first cast on shore and a soil better adapted
for their growth than the loose blocks of coral that the most isolated
of the lagoon-islands would in time possess a far more abundant flora
than they now have 

the list of land animals is even poorer than that of the plants some
of the islets are inhabited by rats which were brought in a ship from
the mauritius wrecked here these rats are considered by mr 
waterhouse as identical with the english kind but they are smaller 
and more brightly coloured there are no true land-birds for a snipe
and a rail rallus phillippensis though living entirely in the dry
herbage belong to the order of waders birds of this order are said
to occur on several of the small low islands in the pacific at
ascension where there is no land-bird a rail porphyrio simplex was
shot near the summit of the mountain and it was evidently a solitary
straggler at tristan d acunha where according to carmichael there
are only two land-birds there is a coot from these facts i believe
that the waders after the innumerable web-footed species are
generally the first colonists of small isolated islands i may add 
that whenever i noticed birds not of oceanic species very far out at
sea they always belonged to this order and hence they would naturally
become the earliest colonists of any remote point of land 

of reptiles i saw only one small lizard of insects i took pains to
collect every kind exclusive of spiders which were numerous there
were thirteen species of these one only was a beetle a small
ant swarmed by thousands under the loose dry blocks of coral and was
the only true insect which was abundant although the productions of
the land are thus scanty if we look to the waters of the surrounding
sea the number of organic beings is indeed infinite chamisso has
described the natural history of a lagoon-island in the radack
archipelago and it is remarkable how closely its inhabitants in
number and kind resemble those of keeling island there is one lizard
and two waders namely a snipe and curlew of plants there are
nineteen species including a fern and some of these are the same with
those growing here though on a spot so immensely remote and in a
different ocean 

the long strips of land forming the linear islets have been raised
only to that height to which the surf can throw fragments of coral and
the wind heap up calcareous sand the solid flat of coral rock on the
outside by its breadth breaks the first violence of the waves which
otherwise in a day would sweep away these islets and all their
productions the ocean and the land seem here struggling for mastery 
although terra firma has obtained a footing the denizens of the water
think their claim at least equally good in every part one meets
hermit crabs of more than one species carrying on their backs the
shells which they have stolen from the neighbouring beach overhead 
numerous gannets frigate-birds and terns rest on the trees and the
wood from the many nests and from the smell of the atmosphere might
be called a sea-rookery the gannets sitting on their rude nests 
gaze at one with a stupid yet angry air the noddies as their name
expresses are silly little creatures but there is one charming bird 
it is a small snow-white tern which smoothly hovers at the distance
of a few feet above one s head its large black eye scanning with
quiet curiosity your expression little imagination is required to
fancy that so light and delicate a body must be tenanted by some
wandering fairy spirit 

sunday april rd after service i accompanied captain fitz roy to the
settlement situated at the distance of some miles on the point of an
islet thickly covered with tall cocoa-nut trees captain ross and mr 
liesk live in a large barn-like house open at both ends and lined with
mats made of woven bark the houses of the malays are arranged along
the shore of the lagoon the whole place had rather a desolate aspect 
for there were no gardens to show the signs of care and cultivation 
the natives belong to different islands in the east indian archipelago 
but all speak the same language we saw the inhabitants of borneo 
celebes java and sumatra in colour they resemble the tahitians 
from whom they do not widely differ in features some of the women 
however show a good deal of the chinese character i liked both their
general expressions and the sound of their voices they appeared poor 
and their houses were destitute of furniture but it was evident from
the plumpness of the little children that cocoa-nuts and turtle afford
no bad sustenance 

on this island the wells are situated from which ships obtain water 
at first sight it appears not a little remarkable that the fresh water
should regularly ebb and flow with the tides and it has even been
imagined that sand has the power of filtering the salt from the
sea-water these ebbing wells are common on some of the low islands in
the west indies the compressed sand or porous coral rock is
permeated like a sponge with the salt water but the rain which falls
on the surface must sink to the level of the surrounding sea and must
accumulate there displacing an equal bulk of the salt water as the
water in the lower part of the great sponge-like coral mass rises and
falls with the tides so will the water near the surface and this will
keep fresh if the mass be sufficiently compact to prevent much
mechanical admixture but where the land consists of great loose blocks
of coral with open interstices if a well be dug the water as i have
seen is brackish 

after dinner we stayed to see a curious half superstitious scene acted
by the malay women a large wooden spoon dressed in garments and
which had been carried to the grave of a dead man they pretend becomes
inspired at the full of the moon and will dance and jump about after
the proper preparations the spoon held by two women became
convulsed and danced in good time to the song of the surrounding
children and women it was a most foolish spectacle but mr liesk
maintained that many of the malays believed in its spiritual movements 
the dance did not commence till the moon had risen and it was well
worth remaining to behold her bright orb so quietly shining through the
long arms of the cocoa-nut trees as they waved in the evening breeze 
these scenes of the tropics are in themselves so delicious that they
almost equal those dearer ones at home to which we are bound by each
best feeling of the mind 

the next day i employed myself in examining the very interesting yet
simple structure and origin of these islands the water being unusually
smooth i waded over the outer flat of dead rock as far as the living
mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks in some of
the gullies and hollows there were beautiful green and other coloured
fishes and the form and tints of many of the zoophytes were admirable 
it is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of
organic beings with which the sea of the tropics so prodigal of life 
teems yet i must confess i think those naturalists who have described 
in well-known words the submarine grottoes decked with a thousand
beauties have indulged in rather exuberant language 

april th i accompanied captain fitz roy to an island at the head of
the lagoon the channel was exceedingly intricate winding through
fields of delicately branched corals we saw several turtle and two
boats were then employed in catching them the water was so clear and
shallow that although at first a turtle quickly dives out of sight 
yet in a canoe or boat under sail the pursuers after no very long
chase come up to it a man standing ready in the bow at this moment
dashes through the water upon the turtle s back then clinging with
both hands by the shell of its neck he is carried away till the animal
becomes exhausted and is secured it was quite an interesting chase to
see the two boats thus doubling about and the men dashing head
foremost into the water trying to seize their prey captain moresby
informs me that in the chagos archipelago in this same ocean the
natives by a horrible process take the shell from the back of the
living turtle it is covered with burning charcoal which causes the
outer shell to curl upwards it is then forced off with a knife and
before it becomes cold flattened between boards after this barbarous
process the animal is suffered to regain its native element where 
after a certain time a new shell is formed it is however too thin
to be of any service and the animal always appears languishing and
sickly 

when we arrived at the head of the lagoon we crossed a narrow islet 
and found a great surf breaking on the windward coast i can hardly
explain the reason but there is to my mind much grandeur in the view
of the outer shores of these lagoon-islands there is a simplicity in
the barrier-like beach the margin of green bushes and tall cocoa-nuts 
the solid flat of dead coral-rock strewed here and there with great
loose fragments and the line of furious breakers all rounding away
towards either hand the ocean throwing its waters over the broad reef
appears an invincible all-powerful enemy yet we see it resisted and
even conquered by means which at first seem most weak and inefficient 
it is not that the ocean spares the rock of coral the great fragments
scattered over the reef and heaped on the beach whence the tall
cocoa-nut springs plainly bespeak the unrelenting power of the waves 
nor are any periods of repose granted the long swell caused by the
gentle but steady action of the trade-wind always blowing in one
direction over a wide area causes breakers almost equalling in force
those during a gale of wind in the temperate regions and which never
cease to rage it is impossible to behold these waves without feeling
a conviction that an island though built of the hardest rock let it
be porphyry granite or quartz would ultimately yield and be
demolished by such an irresistible power yet these low insignificant
coral-islets stand and are victorious for here another power as an
antagonist takes part in the contest the organic forces separate the
atoms of carbonate of lime one by one from the foaming breakers and
unite them into a symmetrical structure let the hurricane tear up its
thousand huge fragments yet what will that tell against the
accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day 
month after month thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a
polypus through the agency of the vital laws conquering the great
mechanical power of the waves of an ocean which neither the art of man
nor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist 

we did not return on board till late in the evening for we stayed a
long time in the lagoon examining the fields of coral and the gigantic
shells of the chama into which if a man were to put his hand he
would not as long as the animal lived be able to withdraw it near
the head of the lagoon i was much surprised to find a wide area 
considerably more than a mile square covered with a forest of
delicately branching corals which though standing upright were all
dead and rotten at first i was quite at a loss to understand the
cause afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following
rather curious combination of circumstances it should however first
be stated that corals are not able to survive even a short exposure in
the air to the sun s rays so that their upward limit of growth is
determined by that of lowest water at spring tides it appears from
some old charts that the long island to windward was formerly
separated by wide channels into several islets this fact is likewise
indicated by the trees being younger on these portions under the
former condition of the reef a strong breeze by throwing more water
over the barrier would tend to raise the level of the lagoon now it
acts in a directly contrary manner for the water within the lagoon not
only is not increased by currents from the outside but is itself blown
outwards by the force of the wind hence it is observed that the tide
near the head of the lagoon does not rise so high during a strong
breeze as it does when it is calm this difference of level although
no doubt very small has i believe caused the death of those
coral-groves which under the former and more open condition of the
outer reef has attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth 

a few miles north of keeling there is another small atoll the lagoon
of which is nearly filled up with coral-mud captain ross found
embedded in the conglomerate on the outer coast a well-rounded
fragment of greenstone rather larger than a man s head he and the men
with him were so much surprised at this that they brought it away and
preserved it as a curiosity the occurrence of this one stone where
every other particle of matter is calcareous certainly is very
puzzling the island has scarcely ever been visited nor is it
probable that a ship had been wrecked there from the absence of any
better explanation i came to the conclusion that it must have come
entangled in the roots of some large tree when however i considered
the great distance from the nearest land the combination of chances
against a stone thus being entangled the tree washed into the sea 
floated so far then landed safely and the stone finally so embedded
as to allow of its discovery i was almost afraid of imagining a means
of transport apparently so improbable it was therefore with great
interest that i found chamisso the justly distinguished naturalist who
accompanied kotzebue stating that the inhabitants of the radack
archipelago a group of lagoon-islands in the midst of the pacific 
obtained stones for sharpening their instruments by searching the roots
of trees which are cast upon the beach it will be evident that this
must have happened several times since laws have been established that
such stones belong to the chief and a punishment is inflicted on any
one who attempts to steal them when the isolated position of these
small islands in the midst of a vast ocean their great distance from
any land excepting that of coral formation attested by the value which
the inhabitants who are such bold navigators attach to a stone of any
kind and the slowness of the currents of the open sea are all
considered the occurrence of pebbles thus transported does appear
wonderful stones may often be thus carried and if the island on
which they are stranded is constructed of any other substance besides
coral they would scarcely attract attention and their origin at least
would never be guessed moreover this agency may long escape
discovery from the probability of trees especially those loaded with
stones floating beneath the surface in the channels of tierra del
fuego large quantities of drift timber are cast upon the beach yet it
is extremely rare to meet a tree swimming on the water these facts
may possibly throw light on single stones whether angular or rounded 
occasionally found embedded in fine sedimentary masses 

during another day i visited west islet on which the vegetation was
perhaps more luxuriant than on any other the cocoa-nut trees generally
grow separate but here the young ones flourished beneath their tall
parents and formed with their long and curved fronds the most shady
arbours those alone who have tried it know how delicious it is to be
seated in such shade and drink the cool pleasant fluid of the
cocoa-nut in this island there is a large bay-like space composed of
the finest white sand it is quite level and is only covered by the
tide at high water from this large bay smaller creeks penetrate the
surrounding woods to see a field of glittering white sand 
representing water with the cocoa-nut trees extending their tall and
waving trunks around the margin formed a singular and very pretty view 

i have before alluded to a crab which lives on the cocoa-nuts it is
very common on all parts of the dry land and grows to a monstrous
size it is closely allied or identical with the birgos latro the
front pair of legs terminate in very strong and heavy pincers and the
last pair are fitted with others weaker and much narrower it would at
first be thought quite impossible for a crab to open a strong cocoa-nut
covered with the husk but mr liesk assures me that he has repeatedly
seen this effected the crab begins by tearing the husk fibre by
fibre and always from that end under which the three eye-holes are
situated when this is completed the crab commences hammering with its
heavy claws on one of the eye-holes till an opening is made then
turning round its body by the aid of its posterior and narrow pair of
pincers it extracts the white albuminous substance i think this is as
curious a case of instinct as ever i heard of and likewise of
adaptation in structure between two objects apparently so remote from
each other in the scheme of nature as a crab and a cocoa-nut tree the
birgos is diurnal in its habits but every night it is said to pay a
visit to the sea no doubt for the purpose of moistening its branchiae 
the young are likewise hatched and live for some time on the coast 
these crabs inhabit deep burrows which they hollow out beneath the
roots of trees and where they accumulate surprising quantities of the
picked fibres of the cocoa-nut husk on which they rest as on a bed 
the malays sometimes take advantage of this and collect the fibrous
mass to use as junk these crabs are very good to eat moreover under
the tail of the larger ones there is a mass of fat which when melted 
sometimes yields as much as a quart bottle full of limpid oil it has
been stated by some authors that the birgos crawls up the cocoa-nut
trees for the purpose of stealing the nuts i very much doubt the
possibility of this but with the pandanus the task would be very
much easier i was told by mr liesk that on these islands the birgos
lives only on the nuts which have fallen to the ground 

captain moresby informs me that this crab inhabits the chagos and
seychelle groups but not the neighbouring maldiva archipelago it
formerly abounded at mauritius but only a few small ones are now found
there in the pacific this species or one with closely allied
habits is said to inhabit a single coral island north of the
society group to show the wonderful strength of the front pair of
pincers i may mention that captain moresby confined one in a strong
tin-box which had held biscuits the lid being secured with wire but
the crab turned down the edges and escaped in turning down the edges 
it actually punched many small holes quite through the tin 

i was a good deal surprised by finding two species of coral of the
genus millepora m complanata and alcicornis possessed of the power
of stinging the stony branches or plates when taken fresh from the
water have a harsh feel and are not slimy although possessing a
strong and disagreeable smell the stinging property seems to vary in
different specimens when a piece was pressed or rubbed on the tender
skin of the face or arm a pricking sensation was usually caused which
came on after the interval of a second and lasted only for a few
minutes one day however by merely touching my face with one of the
branches pain was instantaneously caused it increased as usual after
a few seconds and remaining sharp for some minutes was perceptible
for half an hour afterwards the sensation was as bad as that from a
nettle but more like that caused by the physalia or portuguese
man-of-war little red spots were produced on the tender skin of the
arm which appeared as if they would have formed watery pustules but
did not m quoy mentions this case of the millepora and i have heard
of stinging corals in the west indies many marine animals seem to
have this power of stinging besides the portuguese man-of-war many
jelly-fish and the aplysia or sea-slug of the cape de verd islands it
is stated in the voyage of the astrolabe that an actinia or
sea-anemone as well as a flexible coralline allied to sertularia both
possess this means of offence or defence in the east indian sea a
stinging sea-weed is said to be found 

two species of fish of the genus scarus which are common here 
exclusively feed on coral both are coloured of a splendid
bluish-green one living invariably in the lagoon and the other
amongst the outer breakers mr liesk assured us that he had
repeatedly seen whole shoals grazing with their strong bony jaws on the
tops of the coral branches i opened the intestines of several and
found them distended with yellowish calcareous sandy mud the slimy
disgusting holuthuriae allied to our star-fish which the chinese
gourmands are so fond of also feed largely as i am informed by dr 
allan on corals and the bony apparatus within their bodies seems well
adapted for this end these holuthuriae the fish the numerous
burrowing shells and nereidous worms which perforate every block of
dead coral must be very efficient agents in producing the fine white
mud which lies at the bottom and on the shores of the lagoon a
portion however of this mud which when wet resembled pounded chalk 
was found by professor ehrenberg to be partly composed of
siliceous-shielded infusoria 

april th in the morning we stood out of the lagoon on our passage
to the isle of france i am glad we have visited these islands such
formations surely rank high amongst the wonderful objects of this
world captain fitz roy found no bottom with a line feet in
length at the distance of only yards from the shore hence this
island forms a lofty submarine mountain with sides steeper even than
those of the most abrupt volcanic cone the saucer-shaped summit is
nearly ten miles across and every single atom from the least
particle to the largest fragment of rock in this great pile which
however is small compared with very many other lagoon-islands bears
the stamp of having been subjected to organic arrangement we feel
surprise when travellers tell us of the vast dimensions of the pyramids
and other great ruins but how utterly insignificant are the greatest
of these when compared to these mountains of stone accumulated by the
agency of various minute and tender animals this is a wonder which
does not at first strike the eye of the body but after reflection 
the eye of reason 

i will now give a very brief account of the three great classes of
coral-reefs namely atolls barrier and fringing-reefs and will
explain my views on their formation almost every voyager who has
crossed the pacific has expressed his unbounded astonishment at the
lagoon-islands or as i shall for the future call them by their indian
name of atolls and has attempted some explanation even as long ago
as the year pyrard de laval well exclaimed c est

une merveille de voir chacun de ces atollons environne d un grand banc

accompanying sketch of whitsunday island in the pacific copied from 
capt beechey s admirable voyage gives but a faint idea of the
singular aspect of an atoll it is one of the smallest size and has
its narrow islets united together in a ring the immensity of the
ocean the fury of the breakers contrasted with the lowness of the
land and the smoothness of the bright green water within the lagoon 
can hardly be imagined without having been seen 

the earlier voyagers fancied that the coral-building animals
instinctively built up their great circles to afford themselves
protection in the inner parts but so far is this from the truth that
those massive kinds to whose growth on the exposed outer shores the
very existence of the reef depends cannot live within the lagoon 
where other delicately-branching kinds flourish moreover on this
view many species of distinct genera and families are supposed to
combine for one end and of such a combination not a single instance
can be found in the whole of nature the theory that has been most
generally received is that atolls are based on submarine craters but
when we consider the form and size of some the number proximity and
relative positions of others this idea loses its plausible character 
thus suadiva atoll is geographical miles in diameter in one line by
 miles in another line rimsky is by miles across and it has a
strangely sinuous margin bow atoll is miles long and on an average
only in width menchicoff atoll consists of three atolls united or
tied together this theory moreover is totally inapplicable to the
northern maldiva atolls in the indian ocean one of which is miles
in length and between and in breadth for they are not bounded
like ordinary atolls by narrow reefs but by a vast number of separate
little atolls other little atolls rising out of the great central
lagoon-like spaces a third and better theory was advanced by
chamisso who thought that from the corals growing more vigorously
where exposed to the open sea as undoubtedly is the case the outer
edges would grow up from the general foundation before any other part 
and that this would account for the ring or cup-shaped structure but
we shall immediately see that in this as well as in the
crater-theory a most important consideration has been overlooked 
namely on what have the reef-building corals which cannot live at a
great depth based their massive structures 

numerous soundings were carefully taken by captain fitz roy on the
steep outside of keeling atoll and it was found that within ten
fathoms the prepared tallow at the bottom of the lead invariably came
up marked with the impression of living corals but as perfectly clean
as if it had been dropped on a carpet of turf as the depth increased 
the impressions became less numerous but the adhering particles of
sand more and more numerous until at last it was evident that the
bottom consisted of a smooth sandy layer to carry on the analogy of
the turf the blades of grass grew thinner and thinner till at last
the soil was so sterile that nothing sprang from it from these
observations confirmed by many others it may be safely inferred that
the utmost depth at which corals can construct reefs is between and
 fathoms now there are enormous areas in the pacific and indian
ocean in which every single island is of coral formation and is
raised only to that height to which the waves can throw up fragments 
and the winds pile up sand thus radack group of atolls is an
irregular square miles long and broad the low archipelago is
elliptic-formed miles in its longer and in its shorter axis 
there are other small groups and single low islands between these two
archipelagoes making a linear space of ocean actually more than 
miles in length in which not one single island rises above the
specified height again in the indian ocean there is a space of ocean
 miles in length including three archipelagoes in which every
island is low and of coral formation from the fact of the
reef-building corals not living at great depths it is absolutely
certain that throughout these vast areas wherever there is now an
atoll a foundation must have originally existed within a depth of from
 to fathoms from the surface it is improbable in the highest
degree that broad lofty isolated steep-sided banks of sediment 
arranged in groups and lines hundreds of leagues in length could have
been deposited in the central and profoundest parts of the pacific and
indian oceans at an immense distance from any continent and where the
water is perfectly limpid it is equally improbable that the elevatory
forces should have uplifted throughout the above vast areas 
innumerable great rocky banks within to fathoms or to 
feet of the surface of the sea and not one single point above that
level for where on the whole surface of the globe can we find a single
chain of mountains even a few hundred miles in length with their many
summits rising within a few feet of a given level and not one pinnacle
above it if then the foundations whence the atoll-building corals
sprang were not formed of sediment and if they were not lifted up to
the required level they must of necessity have subsided into it and
this at once solves the difficulty for as mountain after mountain 
and island after island slowly sank beneath the water fresh bases
would be successively afforded for the growth of the corals it is
impossible here to enter into all the necessary details but i venture
to defy any one to explain in any other manner how it is possible
that numerous islands should be distributed throughout vast areas all
the islands being low all being built of corals absolutely requiring
a foundation within a limited depth from the surface 

before explaining how atoll-formed reefs acquire their peculiar
structure we must turn to the second great class namely 
barrier-reefs these either extend in straight lines in front of the
shores of a continent or of a large island or they encircle smaller
islands in both cases being separated from the land by a broad and
rather deep channel of water analogous to the lagoon within an atoll 
it is remarkable how little attention has been paid to encircling
barrier-reefs yet they are truly wonderful structures the following
sketch represents part of the barrier encircling the island of bolabola
in the pacific as seen from one of the central peaks in this instance
the whole line of reef has been converted into land but usually a
snow-white line of great breakers with only here and there a single
low islet crowned with cocoa-nut trees divides the dark heaving waters
of the ocean from the light-green expanse of the lagoon-channel and
the quiet waters of this channel generally bathe a fringe of low
alluvial soil loaded with the most beautiful productions of the
tropics and lying at the foot of the wild abrupt central mountains 

encircling barrier-reefs are of all sizes from three miles to no less
than forty-four miles in diameter and that which fronts one side and
encircles both ends of new caledonia is miles long each reef
includes one two or several rocky islands of various heights and in
one instance even as many as twelve separate islands the reef runs
at a greater or less distance from the included land in the society
archipelago generally from one to three or four miles but at hogoleu
the reef is miles on the southern side and miles on the opposite
or northern side from the included islands the depth within the
lagoon-channel also varies much from to fathoms may be taken as
an average but at vanikoro there are spaces no less than fathoms or
 feet deep internally the reef either slopes gently into the
lagoon-channel or ends in a perpendicular wall sometimes between two
and three hundred feet under water in height externally the reef
rises like an atoll with extreme abruptness out of the profound
depths of the ocean 

what can be more singular than these structures we see

 picture 

an island which may be compared to a castle situated on the summit of
a lofty submarine mountain protected by a great wall of coral-rock 
always steep externally and sometimes internally with a broad level
summit here and there breached by a narrow gateway through which the
largest ships can enter the wide and deep encircling moat 

as far as the actual reef of coral is concerned there is not the
smallest difference in general size outline grouping and even in
quite trifling details of structure between a barrier and an atoll 
the geographer balbi has well remarked that an encircled island is an
atoll with high land rising out of its lagoon remove the land from
within and a perfect atoll is left 

but what has caused these reefs to spring up at such great distances
from the shores of the included islands it cannot be that the corals
will not grow close to the land for the shores within the
lagoon-channel when not surrounded by alluvial soil are often fringed
by living reefs and we shall presently see that there is a whole
class which i have called fringing reefs from their close attachment
to the shores both of continents and of islands again on what have
the reef-building corals which cannot live at great depths based
their encircling structures this is a great apparent difficulty 
analogous to that in the case of atolls which has generally been
overlooked it will be perceived more clearly by inspecting the
following sections which are real ones taken in north and south lines 
through the islands with their barrier-reefs of vanikoro gambier and
maurua and they are laid down both vertically and horizontally on
the same scale of a quarter of an inch to a mile 

it should be observed that the sections might have been taken in any
direction through these islands or through

 picture 

many other encircled islands and the general features would have been
the same now bearing in mind that reef-building coral cannot live at
a greater depth than from to fathoms and that the scale is so
small that the plummets on the right hand show a depth of fathoms 
on what are these barrier-reefs based are we to suppose that each
island is surrounded by a collar-like submarine ledge of rock or by a
great bank of sediment ending abruptly where the reef ends 

if the sea had formerly eaten deeply into the islands before they were
protected by the reefs thus having left a shallow ledge round them
under water the present shores would have been invariably bounded by
great precipices but this is most rarely the case moreover on this
notion it is not possible to explain why the corals should have sprung
up like a wall from the extreme outer margin of the ledge often
leaving a broad space of water within too deep for the growth of
corals the accumulation of a wide bank of sediment all round these
islands and generally widest where the included islands are smallest 
is highly improbable considering their exposed positions in the
central and deepest parts of the ocean in the case of the
barrier-reef of new caledonia which extends for miles beyond the
northern point of the islands in the same straight line with which it
fronts the west coast it is hardly possible to believe that a bank of
sediment could thus have been straightly deposited in front of a lofty
island and so far beyond its termination in the open sea finally if
we look to other oceanic islands of about the same height and of
similar geological constitution but not encircled by coral-reefs we
may in vain search for so trifling a circumambient depth as fathoms 
except quite near to their shores for usually land that rises abruptly
out of water as do most of the encircled and non-encircled oceanic
islands plunges abruptly under it on what then i repeat are these
barrier reefs based why with their wide and deep moat-like channels 
do they stand so far from the included land we shall soon see how
easily these difficulties disappear 

we come now to our third class of fringing-reefs which will require a
very short notice where the land slopes abruptly under water these
reefs are only a few yards in width forming a mere ribbon or fringe
round the shores where the land slopes gently under the water the reef
extends further sometimes even as much as a mile from the land but in
such cases the soundings outside the reef always show that the
submarine prolongation of the land is gently inclined in fact the
reefs extend only to that distance from the shore at which a
foundation within the requisite depth from to fathoms is found 
as far as the actual reef is concerned there is no essential
difference between it and that forming a barrier or an atoll it is 
however generally of less width and consequently few islets have been
formed on it from the corals growing more vigorously on the outside 
and from the noxious effect of the sediment washed inwards the outer
edge of the reef is the highest part and between it and the land there
is generally a shallow sandy channel a few feet in depth where banks
or sediments have accumulated near to the surface as in parts of the
west indies they sometimes become fringed with corals and hence in
some degree resemble lagoon-islands or atolls in the same manner as
fringing-reefs surrounding gently sloping islands in some degree
resemble barrier-reefs 


no theory on the formation of coral-reefs can be considered
satisfactory which does not include the three great

 picture 

classes we have seen that we are driven to believe in the subsidence
of those vast areas interspersed with low islands of which not one
rises above the height to which the wind and waves can throw up matter 
and yet are constructed by animals requiring a foundation and that
foundation to lie at no great depth let us then take an island
surrounded by fringing-reefs which offer no difficulty in their
structure and let this island with its reefs represented by the
unbroken lines in the woodcut slowly subside now as the island
sinks down either a few feet at a time or quite insensibly we may
safely infer from what is known of the conditions favourable to the
growth of coral that the living masses bathed by the surf on the
margin of the reef will soon regain the surface the water however 
will encroach little by little on the shore the island becoming lower
and smaller and the space between the inner edge of the reef and the
beach proportionately broader a section of the reef and island in
this state after a subsidence of several hundred feet is given by the
dotted lines coral islets are supposed to have been formed on the
reef and a ship is anchored in the lagoon-channel this channel will
be more or less deep according to the rate of subsidence to the
amount of sediment accumulated in it and to the growth of the
delicately branched corals which can live there the section in this
state resembles in every respect one drawn through an encircled island 
in fact it is a real section on the scale of of an inch to a
mile through bolabola in the pacific we can now at once see why
encircling barrier-reefs stand so far from the shores which they front 
we can also perceive that a line drawn perpendicularly down from the
outer edge of the new reef to the foundation of solid rock beneath the
old fringing-reef will exceed by as many feet as there have been feet
of subsidence that small limit of depth at which the effective corals
can live the little architects having built up their great wall-like
mass as the whole sank down upon a basis formed of other corals and
their consolidated fragments thus the difficulty on this head which
appeared so great disappears 

if instead of an island we had taken the shore of a continent fringed
with reefs and had imagined it to have subsided a great straight
barrier like that of australia or new caledonia separated from the
land by a wide and deep channel would evidently have been the result 

let us take our new encircling barrier-reef of which the section is
now represented by unbroken lines and which as i have said is a real
section through bolabola and let it go on subsiding as the
barrier-reef slowly sinks down the corals will go on vigorously
growing upwards but as the island sinks the water will gain inch by
inch on the shore the separate mountains first forming separate
islands within

 picture 

one great reef and finally the last and highest pinnacle
disappearing the instant this takes place a perfect atoll is formed 
i have said remove the high land from within an encircling
barrier-reef and an atoll is left and the land has been removed we
can now perceive how it comes that atolls having sprung from
encircling barrier-reefs resemble them in general size form in the
manner in which they are grouped together and in their arrangement in
single or double lines for they may be called rude outline charts of
the sunken islands over which they stand we can further see how it
arises that the atolls in the pacific and indian oceans extend in lines
parallel to the generally prevailing strike of the high islands and
great coast-lines of those oceans i venture therefore to affirm 
that on the theory of the upward growth of the corals during the
sinking of the land all the leading features in those wonderful
structures the lagoon-islands or atolls which have so long excited
the attention of voyagers as well as in the no less wonderful
barrier-reefs whether encircling small islands or stretching for
hundreds of miles along the shores of a continent are simply explained 

it may be asked whether i can offer any direct evidence of the
subsidence of barrier-reefs or atolls but it must be borne in mind how
difficult it must ever be to detect a movement the tendency of which
is to hide under water the part affected nevertheless at keeling
atoll i observed on all sides of the lagoon old cocoa-nut trees
undermined and falling and in one place the foundation-posts of a
shed which the inhabitants asserted had stood seven years before just
above high-water mark but now was daily washed by every tide on
inquiry i found that three earthquakes one of them severe had been
felt here during the last ten years at vanikoro the lagoon-channel
is remarkably deep scarcely any alluvial soil has accumulated at the
foot of the lofty included mountains and remarkably few islets have
been formed by the heaping of fragments and sand on the wall-like
barrier reef these facts and some analogous ones led me to believe
that this island must lately have subsided and the reef grown upwards 
here again earthquakes are frequent and very severe in the society
archipelago on the other hand where the lagoon-channels are almost
choked up where much low alluvial land has accumulated and where in
some cases long islets have been formed on the barrier-reefs facts
all showing that the islands have not very lately subsided only feeble
shocks are most rarely felt in these coral formations where the land
and water seem struggling for mastery it must be ever difficult to
decide between the effects of a change in the set of the tides and of a
slight subsidence that many of these reefs and atolls are subject to
changes of some kind is certain on some atolls the islets appear to
have increased greatly within a late period on others they have been
partially or wholly washed away the inhabitants of parts of the
maldiva archipelago know the date of the first formation of some
islets in other parts the corals are now flourishing on water-washed
reefs where holes made for graves attest the former existence of
inhabited land it is difficult to believe in frequent changes in the
tidal currents of an open ocean whereas we have in the earthquakes
recorded by the natives on some atolls and in the great fissures
observed on other atolls plain evidence of changes and disturbances in
progress in the subterranean regions 

it is evident on our theory that coasts merely fringed by reefs
cannot have subsided to any perceptible amount and therefore they
must since the growth of their corals either have remained stationary
or have been upheaved now it is remarkable how generally it can be
shown by the presence of upraised organic remains that the fringed
islands have been elevated and so far this is indirect evidence in
favour of our theory i was particularly struck with this fact when i
found to my surprise that the descriptions given by mm quoy and
gaimard were applicable not to reefs in general as implied by them 
but only to those of the fringing class my surprise however ceased
when i afterwards found that by a strange chance all the several
islands visited by these eminent naturalists could be shown by their
own statements to have been elevated within a recent geological era 

not only the grand features in the structure of barrier-reefs and of
atolls and to their likeness to each other in form size and other
characters are explained on the theory of subsidence which theory we
are independently forced to admit in the very areas in question from
the necessity of finding bases for the corals within the requisite
depth but many details in structure and exceptional cases can thus
also be simply explained i will give only a few instances in
barrier-reefs it has long been remarked with surprise that the
passages through the reef exactly face valleys in the included land 
even in cases where the reef is separated from the land by a
lagoon-channel so wide and so much deeper than the actual passage
itself that it seems hardly possible that the very small quantity of
water or sediment brought down could injure the corals on the reef 
now every reef of the fringing class is breached by a narrow gateway
in front of the smallest rivulet even if dry during the greater part
of the year for the mud sand or gravel occasionally washed down
kills the corals on which it is deposited consequently when an
island thus fringed subsides though most of the narrow gateways will
probably become closed by the outward and upward growth of the corals 
yet any that are not closed and some must always be kept open by the
sediment and impure water flowing out of the lagoon-channel will still
continue to front exactly the upper parts of those valleys at the
mouths of which the original basal fringing-reef was breached 

we can easily see how an island fronted only on one side or on one
side with one end or both ends encircled by barrier-reefs might after
long-continued subsidence be converted either into a single wall-like
reef or into an atoll with a great straight spur projecting from it 
or into two or three atolls tied together by straight reefs all of
which exceptional cases actually occur as the reef-building corals
require food are preyed upon by other animals are killed by sediment 
cannot adhere to a loose bottom and may be easily carried down to a
depth whence they cannot spring up again we need feel no surprise at
the reefs both of atolls and barriers becoming in parts imperfect the
great barrier of new caledonia is thus imperfect and broken in many
parts hence after long subsidence this great reef would not produce
one great atoll miles in length but a chain or archipelago of
atolls of very nearly the same dimension with those in the maldiva
archipelago moreover in an atoll once breached on opposite sides 
from the likelihood of the oceanic and tidal currents passing straight
through the breaches it is extremely improbable that the corals 
especially during continued subsidence would ever be able again to
unite the rim if they did not as the whole sank downwards one atoll
would be divided into two or more in the maldiva archipelago there
are distinct atolls so related to each other in position and separated
by channels either unfathomable or very deep the channel between ross
and ari atolls is fathoms and that between the north and south
nillandoo atolls is fathoms in depth that it is impossible to
look at a map of them without believing that they were once more
intimately related and in this same archipelago mahlos-mahdoo atoll
is divided by a bifurcating channel from to fathoms in depth 
in such a manner that it is scarcely possible to say whether it ought
strictly to be called three separate atolls or one great atoll not yet
finally divided 

i will not enter on many more details but i must remark that the
curious structure of the northern maldiva atolls receives taking into
consideration the free entrance of the sea through their broken
margins a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the
corals originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons 
such as occur in common atolls and on broken portions of the linear
marginal reef such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form i
cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these
complex structures a great sandy and generally concave disk rises
abruptly from the unfathomable ocean with its central expanse studded 
and its edge symmetrically bordered with oval basins of coral-rock just
lipping the surface of the sea sometimes clothed with vegetation and
each containing a lake of clear water 

one more point in detail as in the two neighbouring archipelagoes
corals flourish in one and not in the other and as so many conditions
before enumerated must affect their existence it would be an
inexplicable fact if during the changes to which earth air and water
are subjected the reef-building corals were to keep alive for
perpetuity on any one spot or area and as by our theory the areas
including atolls and barrier-reefs are subsiding we ought occasionally
to find reefs both dead and submerged in all reefs owing to the
sediment being washed out of the lagoon-channel to leeward that side
is least favourable to the long-continued vigorous growth of the
corals hence dead portions of reef not unfrequently occur on the
leeward side and these though still retaining their proper wall-like
form are now in several instances sunk several fathoms beneath the
surface the chagos group appears from some cause possibly from the
subsidence having been too rapid at present to be much less favourably
circumstanced for the growth of reefs than formerly one atoll has a
portion of its marginal reef nine miles in length dead and submerged 
a second has only a few quite small living points which rise to the
surface a third and fourth are entirely dead and submerged a fifth is
a mere wreck with its structure almost obliterated it is remarkable
that in all these cases the dead reefs and portions of reef lie at
nearly the same depth namely from six to eight fathoms beneath the
surface as if they had been carried down by one uniform movement one
of these half-drowned atolls so called by capt moresby to whom i
am indebted for much invaluable information is of vast size namely 
ninety nautical miles across in one direction and seventy miles in
another line and is in many respects eminently curious as by our
theory it follows that new atolls will generally be formed in each new
area of subsidence two weighty objections might have been raised 
namely that atolls must be increasing indefinitely in number and
secondly that in old areas of subsidence each separate atoll must be
increasing indefinitely in thickness if proofs of their occasional
destruction could not have been adduced thus have we traced the
history of these great rings of coral-rock from their first origin
through their normal changes and through the occasional accidents of
their existence to their death and final obliteration 


in my volume on coral formations i have published a map in which i
have coloured all the atolls dark-blue the barrier-reefs pale-blue 
and the fringing reefs red these latter reefs have been formed whilst
the land has been stationary or as appears from the frequent presence
of upraised organic remains whilst it has been slowly rising atolls
and barrier-reefs on the other hand have grown up during the directly
opposite movement of subsidence which movement must have been very
gradual and in the case of atolls so vast in amount as to have buried
every mountain-summit over wide ocean-spaces now in this map we see
that the reefs tinted pale and dark-blue which have been produced by
the same order of movement as a general rule manifestly stand near
each other again we see that the areas with the two blue tints are
of wide extent and that they lie separate from extensive lines of
coast coloured red both of which circumstances might naturally have
been inferred on the theory of the nature of the reefs having been
governed by the nature of the earth s movement it deserves notice
that in more than one instance where single red and blue circles
approach near each other i can show that there have been oscillations
of level for in such cases the red or fringed circles consist of
atolls originally by our theory formed during subsidence but
subsequently upheaved and on the other hand some of the pale-blue or
encircled islands are composed of coral-rock which must have been
uplifted to its present height before that subsidence took place 
during which the existing barrier-reefs grew upwards 

authors have noticed with surprise that although atolls are the
commonest coral-structures throughout some enormous oceanic tracts 
they are entirely absent in other seas as in the west indies we can
now at once perceive the cause for where there has not been
subsidence atolls cannot have been formed and in the case of the west
indies and parts of the east indies these tracts are known to have
been rising within the recent period the larger areas coloured red
and blue are all elongated and between the two colours there is a
degree of rude alternation as if the rising of one had balanced the
sinking of the other taking into consideration the proofs of recent
elevation both on the fringed coasts and on some others for instance 
in south america where there are no reefs we are led to conclude that
the great continents are for the most part rising areas and from the
nature of the coral-reefs that the central parts of the great oceans
are sinking areas the east indian archipelago the most broken land
in the world is in most parts an area of elevation but surrounded and
penetrated probably in more lines than one by narrow areas of
subsidence 

i have marked with vermilion spots all the many known active volcanos
within the limits of this same map their entire absence from every
one of the great subsiding areas coloured either pale or dark blue is
most striking and not less so is the coincidence of the chief volcanic
chains with the parts coloured red which we are led to conclude have
either long remained stationary or more generally have been recently
upraised although a few of the vermilion spots occur within no great
distance of single circles tinted blue yet not one single active
volcano is situated within several hundred miles of an archipelago or
even small group of atolls it is therefore a striking fact that in
the friendly archipelago which consists of a group of atolls upheaved
and since partially worn down two volcanos and perhaps more are
historically known to have been in action on the other hand although
most of the islands in the pacific which are encircled by
barrier-reefs are of volcanic origin often with the remnants of
craters still distinguishable not one of them is known to have ever
been in eruption hence in these cases it would appear that volcanos
burst forth into action and become extinguished on the same spots 
accordingly as elevatory or subsiding movements prevail there 
numberless facts could be adduced to prove that upraised organic
remains are common wherever there are active volcanos but until it
could be shown that in areas of subsidence volcanos were either absent
or inactive the inference however probable in itself that their
distribution depended on the rising or falling of the earth s surface 
would have been hazardous but now i think we may freely admit this
important deduction 

taking a final view of the map and bearing in mind the statements made
with respect to the upraised organic remains we must feel astonished
at the vastness of the areas which have suffered changes in level
either downwards or upwards within a period not geologically remote 
it would appear also that the elevatory and subsiding movements follow
nearly the same laws throughout the spaces interspersed with atolls 
where not a single peak of high land has been left above the level of
the sea the sinking must have been immense in amount the sinking 
moreover whether continuous or recurrent with intervals sufficiently
long for the corals again to bring up their living edifices to the
surface must necessarily have been extremely slow this conclusion is
probably the most important one which can be deduced from the study of
coral formations and it is one which it is difficult to imagine how
otherwise could ever have been arrived at nor can i quite pass over
the probability of the former existence of large archipelagoes of lofty
islands where now only rings of coral-rock scarcely break the open
expanse of the sea throwing some light on the distribution of the
inhabitants of the other high islands now left standing so immensely
remote from each other in the midst of the great oceans the
reef-constructing corals have indeed reared and preserved wonderful
memorials of the subterranean oscillations of level we see in each
barrier-reef a proof that the land has there subsided and in each
atoll a monument over an island now lost we may thus like unto a
geologist who had lived his ten thousand years and kept a record of the
passing changes gain some insight into the great system by which the
surface of this globe has been broken up and land and water
interchanged

 the large claws or pincers of some of these crabs are most
beautifully adapted when drawn back to form an operculum to the

found it so that certain species of the hermit-crab always use certain
species of shells

 i exclude of course some soil which has been imported here in

moreover on the northern island must be excepted 

 these were first read before the geological society in may 
and have since been developed in a separate volume on the structure
and distribution of coral reefs 

 it is remarkable that mr lyell even in the first edition of his
 principles of geology inferred that the amount of subsidence in the
pacific must have exceeded that of elevation from the area of land
being very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it 
namely the growth of coral and volcanic action 

 it has been highly satisfactory to me to find the following
passage in a pamphlet by mr couthouy one of the naturalists in the
great antarctic expedition of the united states having personally
examined a large number of coral-islands and resided eight months among
the volcanic class having shore and partially encircling reefs i may
be permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a
conviction of the correctness of the theory of mr darwin the
naturalists however of this expedition differ with me on some points
respecting coral formations

mauritius to england

vegetation cause of the extinction of
land-shells ascension variation in the imported rats volcanic
bombs beds of infusoria bahia brazil splendour of tropical
scenery pernambuco singular reef slavery return to
england retrospect on our voyage 


april th in the morning we passed round the northern end of
mauritius or the isle of france from this point of view the aspect of
the island equalled the expectations raised by the many well-known
descriptions of its beautiful scenery the sloping plain of the
pamplemousses interspersed with houses and coloured by the large
fields of sugar-cane of a bright green composed the foreground the
brilliancy of the green was the more remarkable because it is a colour
which generally is conspicuous only from a very short distance towards
the centre of the island groups of wooded mountains rose out of this
highly cultivated plain their summits as so commonly happens with
ancient volcanic rocks being jagged into the sharpest points masses
of white clouds were collected around these pinnacles as if for the
sake of pleasing the stranger s eye the whole island with its
sloping border and central mountains was adorned with an air of
perfect elegance the scenery if i may use such an expression 
appeared to the sight harmonious 

i spent the greater part of the next day in walking about the town and
visiting different people the town is of considerable size and is
said to contain inhabitants the streets are very clean and
regular although the island has been so many years under the english
government the general character of the place is quite french 
englishmen speak to their servants in french and the shops are all
french indeed i should think that calais or boulogne was much more
anglified there is a very pretty little theatre in which operas are
excellently performed we were also surprised at seeing large
booksellers shops with well-stored shelves music and reading
bespeak our approach to the old world of civilization for in truth
both australia and america are new worlds 

the various races of men walking in the streets afford the most
interesting spectacle in port louis convicts from india are banished
here for life at present there are about and they are employed in
various public works before seeing these people i had no idea that
the inhabitants of india were such noble-looking figures their skin
is extremely dark and many of the older men had large mustaches and
beards of a snow-white colour this together with the fire of their
expression gave them quite an imposing aspect the greater number had
been banished for murder and the worst crimes others for causes which
can scarcely be considered as moral faults such as for not obeying 
from superstitious motives the english laws these men are generally
quiet and well-conducted from their outward conduct their
cleanliness and faithful observance of their strange religious rites 
it was impossible to look at them with the same eyes as on our wretched
convicts in new south wales 

may st sunday i took a quiet walk along the sea-coast to the north
of the town the plain in this part is quite uncultivated it consists
of a field of black lava smoothed over with coarse grass and bushes 
the latter being chiefly mimosas the scenery may be described as
intermediate in character between that of the galapagos and of tahiti 
but this will convey a definite idea to very few persons it is a very
pleasant country but it has not the charms of tahiti or the grandeur
of brazil the next day i ascended la pouce a mountain so called from
a thumb-like projection which rises close behind the town to a height
of feet the centre of the island consists of a great platform 
surrounded by old broken basaltic mountains with their strata dipping
seawards the central platform formed of comparatively recent streams
of lava is of an oval shape thirteen geographical miles across in
the line of its shorter axis the exterior bounding mountains come
into that class of structures called craters of elevation which are
supposed to have been formed not like ordinary craters but by a great
and sudden upheaval there appears to me to be insuperable objections
to this view on the other hand i can hardly believe in this and in
some other cases that these marginal crateriform mountains are merely
the basal remnants of immense volcanos of which the summits either
have been blown off or swallowed up in subterranean abysses 

from our elevated position we enjoyed an excellent view over the
island the country on this side appears pretty well cultivated being
divided into fields and studded with farm-houses i was however 
assured that of the whole land not more than half is yet in a
productive state if such be the case considering the present large
export of sugar this island at some future period when thickly
peopled will be of great value since england has taken possession of
it a period of only twenty-five years the export of sugar is said to
have increased seventy-five fold one great cause of its prosperity is
the excellent state of the roads in the neighbouring isle of bourbon 
which remains under the french government the roads are still in the
same miserable state as they were here only a few years ago although
the french residents must have largely profited by the increased
prosperity of their island yet the english government is far from
popular 

rd in the evening captain lloyd the surveyor-general so well known
from his examination of the isthmus of panama invited mr stokes and
myself to his country-house which is situated on the edge of wilheim
plains and about six miles from the port we stayed at this
delightful place two days standing nearly feet above the sea the
air was cool and fresh and on every side there were delightful walks 
close by a grand ravine has been worn to a depth of about feet
through the slightly inclined streams of lava which have flowed from
the central platform 

th captain lloyd took us to the riviere noire which is several
miles to the southward that i might examine some rocks of elevated
coral we passed through pleasant gardens and fine fields of
sugar-cane growing amidst huge blocks of lava the roads were bordered
by hedges of mimosa and near many of the houses there were avenues of
the mango some of the views where the peaked hills and the
cultivated farms were seen together were exceedingly picturesque and
we were constantly tempted to exclaim how pleasant it would be to
pass one s life in such quiet abodes captain lloyd possessed an
elephant and he sent it half way with us that we might enjoy a ride
in true indian fashion the circumstance which surprised me most was
its quite noiseless step this elephant is the only one at present on
the island but it is said others will be sent for 


may th we sailed from port louis and calling at the cape of good
hope on the th of july we arrived off st helena this island the
forbidding aspect of which has been so often described rises abruptly
like a huge black castle from the ocean near the town as if to
complete nature s defence small forts and guns fill up every gap in
the rugged rocks the town runs up a flat and narrow valley the
houses look respectable and are interspersed with a very few green
trees when approaching the anchorage there was one striking view an
irregular castle perched on the summit of a lofty hill and surrounded
by a few scattered fir-trees boldly projected against the sky 

the next day i obtained lodgings within a stone s throw of napoleon s
tomb it was a capital central situation whence i could make
excursions in every direction during the four days i stayed here i
wandered over the island from morning to night and examined its
geological history my lodgings were situated at a height of about
 feet here the weather was cold and boisterous with constant
showers of rain and every now and then the whole scene was veiled in
thick clouds 

near the coast the rough lava is quite bare in the central and higher
parts feldspathic rocks by their decomposition have produced a clayey
soil which where not covered by vegetation is stained in broad bands
of many bright colours at this season the land moistened by constant
showers produces a singularly bright green pasture which lower and
lower down gradually fades away and at last disappears in latitude
 degs and at the trifling elevation of feet it is surprising
to behold a vegetation possessing a character decidedly british the
hills are crowned with irregular plantations of scotch firs and the
sloping banks are thickly scattered over with thickets of gorse 
covered with its bright yellow flowers weeping-willows are common on
the banks of the rivulets and the hedges are made of the blackberry 
producing its well-known fruit when we consider that the number of
plants now found on the island is and that out of these fifty-two
alone are indigenous species the rest having been imported and most
of them from england we see the reason of the british character of the
vegetation many of these english plants appear to flourish better than
in their native country some also from the opposite quarter of
australia succeed remarkably well the many imported species must have
destroyed some of the native kinds and it is only on the highest and
steepest ridges that the indigenous flora is now predominant 

the english or rather welsh character of the scenery is kept up by
the numerous cottages and small white houses some buried at the bottom
of the deepest valleys and others mounted on the crests of the lofty
hills some of the views are striking for instance that from near sir
w doveton s house where the bold peak called lot is seen over a dark
wood of firs the whole being backed by the red water-worn mountains of
the southern coast on viewing the island from an eminence the first
circumstance which strikes one is the number of the roads and forts 
the labour bestowed on the public works if one forgets its character
as a prison seems out of all proportion to its extent or value there
is so little level or useful land that it seems surprising how so many
people about can subsist here the lower orders or the
emancipated slaves are i believe extremely poor they complain of the
want of work from the reduction in the number of public servants
owing to the island having been given up by the east indian company 
and the consequent emigration of many of the richer people the poverty
probably will increase the chief food of the working class is rice
with a little salt meat as neither of these articles are the products
of the island but must be purchased with money the low wages tell
heavily on the poor people now that the people are blessed with
freedom a right which i believe they value fully it seems probable
that their numbers will quickly increase if so what is to become of
the little state of st helena 

my guide was an elderly man who had been a goatherd when a boy and
knew every step amongst the rocks he was of a race many times
crossed and although with a dusky skin he had not the disagreeable
expression of a mulatto he was a very civil quiet old man and such
appears the character of the greater number of the lower classes it
was strange to my ears to hear a man nearly white and respectably
dressed talking with indifference of the times when he was a slave 
with my companion who carried our dinners and a horn of water which
is quite necessary as all the water in the lower valleys is saline i
every day took long walks 

beneath the upper and central green circle the wild valleys are quite
desolate and untenanted here to the geologist there were scenes of
high interest showing successive changes and complicated disturbances 
according to my views st helena has existed as an island from a very
remote epoch some obscure proofs however of the elevation of the
land are still extant i believe that the central and highest peaks
form parts of the rim of a great crater the southern half of which has
been entirely removed by the waves of the sea there is moreover an
external wall of black basaltic rocks like the coast-mountains of
mauritius which are older than the central volcanic streams on the
higher parts of the island considerable numbers of a shell long
thought to be a marine species occur imbedded in the soil 

it proved to be a cochlogena or land-shell of a very peculiar form 
 with it i found six other kinds and in another spot an eighth
species it is remarkable that none of them are now found living 
their extinction has probably been caused by the entire destruction of
the woods and the consequent loss of food and shelter which occurred
during the early part of the last century 

the history of the changes which the elevated plains of longwood and
deadwood have undergone as given in general beatson s account of the
island is extremely curious both plains it is said in former times
were covered with wood and were therefore called the great wood so
late as the year there were many trees but in the old trees
had mostly fallen and as goats and hogs had been suffered to range
about all the young trees had been killed it appears also from the
official records that the trees were unexpectedly some years
afterwards succeeded by a wire grass which spread over the whole
surface general beatson adds that now this plain is covered with
fine sward and is become the finest piece of pasture on the island 
the extent of surface probably covered by wood at a former period is
estimated at no less than two thousand acres at the present day
scarcely a single tree can be found there it is also said that in
 there were quantities of dead trees in sandy bay this place is
now so utterly desert that nothing but so well attested an account
could have made me believe that they could ever have grown there the
fact that the goats and hogs destroyed all the young trees as they
sprang up and that in the course of time the old ones which were safe
from their attacks perished from age seems clearly made out goats
were introduced in the year eighty-six years afterwards in the
time of cavendish it is known that they were exceedingly numerous 
more than a century afterwards in when the evil was complete and
irretrievable an order was issued that all stray animals should be
destroyed it is very interesting thus to find that the arrival of
animals at st helena in did not change the whole aspect of the
island until a period of two hundred and twenty years had elapsed for
the goats were introduced in and in it is said the old
trees had mostly fallen there can be little doubt that this great
change in the vegetation affected not only the land-shells causing
eight species to become extinct but likewise a multitude of insects 

st helena situated so remote from any continent in the midst of a
great ocean and possessing a unique flora excites our curiosity the
eight land-shells though now extinct and one living succinea are
peculiar species found nowhere else mr cuming however informs me
that an english helix is common here its eggs no doubt having been
imported in some of the many introduced plants mr cuming collected
on the coast sixteen species of sea-shells of which seven as far as
he knows are confined to this island birds and insects as might
have been expected are very few in number indeed i believe all the
birds have been introduced within late years partridges and pheasants
are tolerably abundant the island is much too english not to be
subject to strict game-laws i was told of a more unjust sacrifice to
such ordinances than i ever heard of even in england the poor people
formerly used to burn a plant which grows on the coast-rocks and
export the soda from its ashes but a peremptory order came out
prohibiting this practice and giving as a reason that the partridges
would have nowhere to build 

in my walks i passed more than once over the grassy plain bounded by
deep valleys on which longwood stands viewed from a short distance 
it appears like a respectable gentleman s country-seat in front there
are a few cultivated fields and beyond them the smooth hill of
coloured rocks called the flagstaff and the rugged square black mass
of the barn on the whole the view was rather bleak and uninteresting 
the only inconvenience i suffered during my walks was from the
impetuous winds one day i noticed a curious circumstance standing on
the edge of a plain terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand
feet in depth i saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward 
some tern struggling against a very strong breeze whilst where i
stood the air was quite calm approaching close to the brink where
the current seemed to be deflected upwards from the face of the cliff 
i stretched out my arm and immediately felt the full force of the
wind an invisible barrier two yards in width separated perfectly
calm air from a strong blast 

i so much enjoyed my rambles among the rocks and mountains of st 
helena that i felt almost sorry on the morning of the th to descend
to the town before noon i was on board and the beagle made sail 

on the th of july we reached ascension those who have beheld a
volcanic island situated under an arid climate will at once be able
to picture to themselves the appearance of ascension they will
imagine smooth conical hills of a bright red colour with their summits
generally truncated rising separately out of a level surface of black
rugged lava a principal mound in the centre of the island seems the
father of the lesser cones it is called green hill its name being
taken from the faintest tinge of that colour which at this time of the
year is barely perceptible from the anchorage to complete the
desolate scene the black rocks on the coast are lashed by a wild and
turbulent sea 

the settlement is near the beach it consists of several houses and
barracks placed irregularly but well built of white freestone the
only inhabitants are marines and some negroes liberated from
slave-ships who are paid and victualled by government there is not a
private person on the island many of the marines appeared well
contented with their situation they think it better to serve their
one-and-twenty years on shore let it be what it may than in a ship 
in this choice if i were a marine i should most heartily agree 

the next morning i ascended green hill feet high and thence
walked across the island to the windward point a good cart-road leads
from the coast-settlement to the houses gardens and fields placed
near the summit of the central mountain on the roadside there are
milestones and likewise cisterns where each thirsty passer-by can
drink some good water similar care is displayed in each part of the
establishment and especially in the management of the springs so that
a single drop of water may not be lost indeed the whole island may be
compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order i could not help 
when admiring the active industry which had created such effects out
of such means at the same time regretting that it had been wasted on
so poor and trifling an end m lesson has remarked with justice that
the english nation would have thought of making the island of ascension
a productive spot any other people would have held it as a mere
fortress in the ocean 

near this coast nothing grows further inland an occasional green
castor-oil plant and a few grasshoppers true friends of the desert 
may be met with some grass is scattered over the surface of the
central elevated region and the whole much resembles the worse parts
of the welsh mountains but scanty as the pasture appears about six
hundred sheep many goats a few cows and horses all thrive well on
it of native animals land-crabs and rats swarm in numbers whether
the rat is really indigenous may well be doubted there are two
varieties as described by mr waterhouse one is of a black colour 
with fine glossy fur and lives on the grassy summit the other is
brown-coloured and less glossy with longer hairs and lives near the
settlement on the coast both these varieties are one-third smaller
than the common black rat m rattus and they differ from it both in
the colour and character of their fur but in no other essential
respect i can hardly doubt that these rats like the common mouse 
which has also run wild have been imported and as at the galapagos 
have varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have
been exposed hence the variety on the summit of the island differs
from that on the coast of native birds there are none but the
guinea-fowl imported from the cape de verd islands is abundant and
the common fowl has likewise run wild some cats which were
originally turned out to destroy the rats and mice have increased so
as to become a great plague the island is entirely without trees in
which and in every other respect it is very far inferior to st 
helena 

one of my excursions took me towards the s w extremity of the island 
the day was clear and hot and i saw the island not smiling with
beauty but staring with naked hideousness the lava streams are
covered with hummocks and are rugged to a degree which geologically
speaking is not of easy explanation the intervening spaces are
concealed with layers of pumice ashes and volcanic tuff whilst
passing this end of the island at sea i could not imagine what the
white patches were with which the whole plain was mottled i now found
that they were seafowl sleeping in such full confidence that even in
midday a man could walk up and seize hold of them these birds were
the only living creatures i saw during the whole day on the beach a
great surf although the breeze was light came tumbling over the
broken lava rocks 

the geology of this island is in many respects interesting in several
places i noticed volcanic bombs that is masses of lava which have
been shot through the air whilst fluid and have consequently assumed a
spherical or pear-shape not only their external form but in several
cases their internal structure shows in a very curious manner that
they have revolved in their aerial course the internal structure of
one of these bombs when broken is represented very accurately in the
woodcut the central part is coarsely cellular the cells decreasing
in size towards the exterior where there is a shell-like case about
the third of an inch in thickness of compact stone which again is
overlaid by the outside crust of finely cellular lava i think there
can be little doubt first that the external crust cooled rapidly in
the state in which we now see it secondly that the still fluid lava
within was packed by the centrifugal force generated by

 picture 

the revolving of the bomb against the external cooled crust and so
produced the solid shell of stone and lastly that the centrifugal
force by relieving the pressure in the more central parts of the bomb 
allowed the heated vapours to expand their cells thus forming the
coarse cellular mass of the centre 

a hill formed of the older series of volcanic rocks and which has
been incorrectly considered as the crater of a volcano is remarkable
from its broad slightly hollowed and circular summit having been
filled up with many successive layers of ashes and fine scoriae these
saucer-shaped layers crop out on the margin forming perfect rings of
many different colours giving to the summit a most fantastic
appearance one of these rings is white and broad and resembles a
course round which horses have been exercised hence the hill has been
called the devil s riding school i brought away specimens of one of
the tufaceous layers of a pinkish colour and it is a most extraordinary
fact that professor ehrenberg finds it almost wholly composed of
matter which has been organized he detects in it some
siliceous-shielded fresh-water infusoria and no less than twenty-five
different kinds of the siliceous tissue of plants chiefly of grasses 
from the absence of all carbonaceous matter professor ehrenberg
believes that these organic bodies have passed through the volcanic
fire and have been erupted in the state in which we now see them the
appearance of the layers induced me to believe that they had been
deposited under water though from the extreme dryness of the climate i
was forced to imagine that torrents of rain had probably fallen during
some great eruption and that thus a temporary lake had been formed
into which the ashes fell but it may now be suspected that the lake
was not a temporary one anyhow we may feel sure that at some former
epoch the climate and productions of ascension were very different from
what they now are where on the face of the earth can we find a spot 
on which close investigation will not discover signs of that endless
cycle of change to which this earth has been is and will be
subjected 

on leaving ascension we sailed for bahia on the coast of brazil in
order to complete the chronometrical measurement of the world we
arrived there on august st and stayed four days during which i took
several long walks i was glad to find my enjoyment in tropical scenery
had not decreased from the want of novelty even in the slightest
degree the elements of the scenery are so simple that they are worth
mentioning as a proof on what trifling circumstances exquisite natural
beauty depends 

the country may be described as a level plain of about three hundred
feet in elevation which in all parts has been worn into flat-bottomed
valleys this structure is remarkable in a granitic land but is
nearly universal in all those softer formations of which plains are
usually composed the whole surface is covered by various kinds of
stately trees interspersed with patches of cultivated ground out of
which houses convents and chapels arise it must be remembered that
within the tropics the wild luxuriance of nature is not lost even in
the vicinity of large cities for the natural vegetation of the hedges
and hill-sides overpowers in picturesque effect the artificial labour
of man hence there are only a few spots where the bright red soil
affords a strong contrast with the universal clothing of green from
the edges of the plain there are distant views either of the ocean or
of the great bay with its low-wooded shores and on which numerous
boats and canoes show their white sails excepting from these points 
the scene is extremely limited following the level pathways on each
hand only glimpses into the wooded valleys below can be obtained the
houses i may add and especially the sacred edifices are built in a
peculiar and rather fantastic style of architecture they are all
whitewashed so that when illumined by the brilliant sun of midday and
as seen against the pale blue sky of the horizon they stand out more
like shadows than real buildings 

such are the elements of the scenery but it is a hopeless attempt to
paint the general effect learned naturalists describe these scenes of
the tropics by naming a multitude of objects and mentioning some
characteristic feature of each to a learned traveller this possibly
may communicate some definite ideas but who else from seeing a plant
in an herbarium can imagine its appearance when growing in its native
soil who from seeing choice plants in a hothouse can magnify some
into the dimensions of forest trees and crowd others into an entangled
jungle who when examining in the cabinet of the entomologist the gay
exotic butterflies and singular cicadas will associate with these
lifeless objects the ceaseless harsh music of the latter and the lazy
flight of the former the sure accompaniments of the still glowing
noon-day of the tropics it is when the sun has attained its greatest
height that such scenes should be viewed then the dense splendid
foliage of the mango hides the ground with its darkest shade whilst
the upper branches are rendered from the profusion of light of the most
brilliant green in the temperate zones the case is different the
vegetation there is not so dark or so rich and hence the rays of the
declining sun tinged of a red purple or bright yellow color add
most to the beauties of those climes 

when quietly walking along the shady pathways and admiring each
successive view i wished to find language to express my ideas epithet
after epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have not
visited the intertropical regions the sensation of delight which the
mind experiences i have said that the plants in a hothouse fail to
communicate a just idea of the vegetation yet i must recur to it the
land is one great wild untidy luxuriant hothouse made by nature for
herself but taken possession of by man who has studded it with gay
houses and formal gardens how great would be the desire in every
admirer of nature to behold if such were possible the scenery of
another planet yet to every person in europe it may be truly said 
that at the distance of only a few degrees from his native soil the
glories of another world are opened to him in my last walk i stopped
again and again to gaze on these beauties and endeavoured to fix in my
mind for ever an impression which at the time i knew sooner or later
must fail the form of the orange-tree the cocoa-nut the palm the
mango the tree-fern the banana will remain clear and separate but
the thousand beauties which unite these into one perfect scene must
fade away yet they will leave like a tale heard in childhood a
picture full of indistinct but most beautiful figures 

august th in the afternoon we stood out to sea with the intention
of making a direct course to the cape de verd islands unfavourable
winds however delayed us and on the th we ran into pernambuco a
large city on the coast of brazil in latitude degs south we
anchored outside the reef but in a short time a pilot came on board
and took us into the inner harbour where we lay close to the town 

pernambuco is built on some narrow and low sand-banks which are
separated from each other by shoal channels of salt water the three
parts of the town are connected together by two long bridges built on
wooden piles the town is in all parts disgusting the streets being
narrow ill-paved and filthy the houses tall and gloomy the season
of heavy rains had hardly come to an end and hence the surrounding
country which is scarcely raised above the level of the sea was
flooded with water and i failed in all my attempts to take walks 

the flat swampy land on which pernambuco stands is surrounded at the
distance of a few miles by a semicircle of low hills or rather by the
edge of a country elevated perhaps two hundred feet above the sea the
old city of olinda stands on one extremity of this range one day i
took a canoe and proceeded up one of the channels to visit it i found
the old town from its situation both sweeter and cleaner than that of
pernambuco i must here commemorate what happened for the first time
during our nearly five years wandering namely having met with a want
of politeness i was refused in a sullen manner at two different
houses and obtained with difficulty from a third permission to pass
through their gardens to an uncultivated hill for the purpose of
viewing the country i feel glad that this happened in the land of the
brazilians for i bear them no good will a land also of slavery and
therefore of moral debasement a spaniard would have felt ashamed at
the very thought of refusing such a request or of behaving to a
stranger with rudeness the channel by which we went to and returned
from olinda was bordered on each side by mangroves which sprang like
a miniature forest out of the greasy mud-banks the bright green
colour of these bushes always reminded me of the rank grass in a
church-yard both are nourished by putrid exhalations the one speaks
of death past and the other too often of death to come 

the most curious object which i saw in this neighbourhood was the reef
that forms the harbour i doubt whether in the whole world any other
natural structure has so artificial an appearance it runs for a
length of several miles in an absolutely straight line parallel to 
and not far distant from the shore it varies in width from thirty to
sixty yards and its surface is level and smooth it is composed of
obscurely stratified hard sandstone at high water the waves break
over it at low water its summit is left dry and it might then be
mistaken for a breakwater erected by cyclopean workmen on this coast
the currents of the sea tend to throw up in front of the land long
spits and bars of loose sand and on one of these part of the town of
pernambuco stands in former times a long spit of this nature seems to
have become consolidated by the percolation of calcareous matter and
afterwards to have been gradually upheaved the outer and loose parts
during this process having been worn away by the action of the sea and
the solid nucleus left as we now see it although night and day the
waves of the open atlantic turbid with sediment are driven against
the steep outside edges of this wall of stone yet the oldest pilots
know of no tradition of any change in its appearance this durability
is much the most curious fact in its history it is due to a tough
layer a few inches thick of calcareous matter wholly formed by the
successive growth and death of the small shells of serpulae together
with some few barnacles and nulliporae these nulliporae which are
hard very simply-organized sea-plants play an analogous and important
part in protecting the upper surfaces of coral-reefs behind and within
the breakers where the true corals during the outward growth of the
mass become killed by exposure to the sun and air these
insignificant organic beings especially the serpulae have done good
service to the people of pernambuco for without their protective aid
the bar of sandstone would inevitably have been long ago worn away and
without the bar there would have been no harbour 

on the th of august we finally left the shores of brazil i thank
god i shall never again visit a slave-country to this day if i hear
a distant scream it recalls with painful vividness my feelings when
passing a house near pernambuco i heard the most pitiable moans and
could not but suspect that some poor slave was being tortured yet knew
that i was as powerless as a child even to remonstrate i suspected
that these moans were from a tortured slave for i was told that this
was the case in another instance near rio de janeiro i lived opposite
to an old lady who kept screws to crush the fingers of her female
slaves i have stayed in a house where a young household mulatto 
daily and hourly was reviled beaten and persecuted enough to break
the spirit of the lowest animal i have seen a little boy six or
seven years old struck thrice with a horse-whip before i could
interfere on his naked head for having handed me a glass of water not
quite clean i saw his father tremble at a mere glance from his
master s eye these latter cruelties were witnessed by me in a spanish
colony in which it has always been said that slaves are better
treated than by the portuguese english or other european nations i
have seen at rio de janeiro a powerful negro afraid to ward off a blow
directed as he thought at his face i was present when a
kind-hearted man was on the point of separating forever the men women 
and little children of a large number of families who had long lived
together i will not even allude to the many heart-sickening
atrocities which i authentically heard of nor would i have mentioned
the above revolting details had i not met with several people so
blinded by the constitutional gaiety of the negro as to speak of
slavery as a tolerable evil such people have generally visited at the
houses of the upper classes where the domestic slaves are usually well
treated and they have not like myself lived amongst the lower
classes such inquirers will ask slaves about their condition they
forget that the slave must indeed be dull who does not calculate on
the chance of his answer reaching his master s ears 

it is argued that self-interest will prevent excessive cruelty as if
self-interest protected our domestic animals which are far less likely
than degraded slaves to stir up the rage of their savage masters it
is an argument long since protested against with noble feeling and
strikingly exemplified by the ever-illustrious humboldt it is often
attempted to palliate slavery by comparing the state of slaves with our
poorer countrymen if the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws
of nature but by our institutions great is our sin but how this
bears on slavery i cannot see as well might the use of the
thumb-screw be defended in one land by showing that men in another
land suffered from some dreadful disease those who look tenderly at
the slave owner and with a cold heart at the slave never seem to put
themselves into the position of the latter what a cheerless prospect 
with not even a hope of change picture to yourself the chance ever
hanging over you of your wife and your little children those objects
which nature urges even the slave to call his own being torn from you
and sold like beasts to the first bidder and these deeds are done and
palliated by men who profess to love their neighbours as themselves 
who believe in god and pray that his will be done on earth it makes
one s blood boil yet heart tremble to think that we englishmen and
our american descendants with their boastful cry of liberty have been
and are so guilty but it is a consolation to reflect that we at least
have made a greater sacrifice than ever made by any nation to expiate
our sin 


on the last day of august we anchored for the second time at porto
praya in the cape de verd archipelago thence we proceeded to the
azores where we stayed six days on the nd of october we made the
shore of england and at falmouth i left the beagle having lived on
board the good little vessel nearly five years 


our voyage having come to an end i will take a short retrospect of the
advantages and disadvantages the pains and pleasures of our
circumnavigation of the world if a person asked my advice before
undertaking a long voyage my answer would depend upon his possessing a
decided taste for some branch of knowledge which could by this means
be advanced no doubt it is a high satisfaction to behold various
countries and the many races of mankind but the pleasures gained at
the time do not counterbalance the evils it is necessary to look
forward to a harvest however distant that may be when some fruit will
be reaped some good effected 

many of the losses which must be experienced are obvious such as that
of the society of every old friend and of the sight of those places
with which every dearest remembrance is so intimately connected these
losses however are at the time partly relieved by the exhaustless
delight of anticipating the long wished-for day of return if as
poets say life is a dream i am sure in a voyage these are the visions
which best serve to pass away the long night other losses although
not at first felt tell heavily after a period these are the want of
room of seclusion of rest the jading feeling of constant hurry the
privation of small luxuries the loss of domestic society and even of
music and the other pleasures of imagination when such trifles are
mentioned it is evident that the real grievances excepting from
accidents of a sea-life are at an end the short space of sixty years
has made an astonishing difference in the facility of distant
navigation even in the time of cook a man who left his fireside for
such expeditions underwent severe privations a yacht now with every
luxury of life can circumnavigate the globe besides the vast
improvements in ships and naval resources the whole western shores of
america are thrown open and australia has become the capital of a
rising continent how different are the circumstances to a man
shipwrecked at the present day in the pacific to what they were in the
time of cook since his voyage a hemisphere has been added to the
civilized world 

if a person suffer much from sea-sickness let him weigh it heavily in
the balance i speak from experience it is no trifling evil cured in
a week if on the other hand he take pleasure in naval tactics he
will assuredly have full scope for his taste but it must be borne in
mind how large a proportion of the time during a long voyage is
spent on the water as compared with the days in harbour and what are
the boasted glories of the illimitable ocean a tedious waste a
desert of water as the arabian calls it no doubt there are some
delightful scenes a moonlight night with the clear heavens and the
dark glittering sea and the white sails filled by the soft air of a
gently blowing trade-wind a dead calm with the heaving surface
polished like a mirror and all still except the occasional flapping of
the canvas it is well once to behold a squall with its rising arch and
coming fury or the heavy gale of wind and mountainous waves i
confess however my imagination had painted something more grand more
terrific in the full-grown storm it is an incomparably finer spectacle
when beheld on shore where the waving trees the wild flight of the
birds the dark shadows and bright lights the rushing of the torrents
all proclaim the strife of the unloosed elements at sea the albatross
and little petrel fly as if the storm were their proper sphere the
water rises and sinks as if fulfilling its usual task the ship alone
and its inhabitants seem the objects of wrath on a forlorn and
weather-beaten coast the scene is indeed different but the feelings
partake more of horror than of wild delight 

let us now look at the brighter side of the past time the pleasure
derived from beholding the scenery and the general aspect of the
various countries we have visited has decidedly been the most constant
and highest source of enjoyment it is probable that the picturesque
beauty of many parts of europe exceeds anything which we beheld but
there is a growing pleasure in comparing the character of the scenery
in different countries which to a certain degree is distinct from
merely admiring its beauty it depends chiefly on an acquaintance with
the individual parts of each view i am strongly induced to believe
that as in music the person who understands every note will if he
also possesses a proper taste more thoroughly enjoy the whole so he
who examines each part of a fine view may also thoroughly comprehend
the full and combined effect hence a traveller should be a botanist 
for in all views plants form the chief embellishment group masses of
naked rock even in the wildest forms and they may for a time afford a
sublime spectacle but they will soon grow monotonous paint them with
bright and varied colours as in northern chile they will become
fantastic clothe them with vegetation they must form a decent if not
a beautiful picture 

when i say that the scenery of parts of europe is probably superior to
anything which we beheld i except as a class by itself that of the
intertropical zones the two classes cannot be compared together but
i have already often enlarged on the grandeur of those regions as the
force of impressions generally depends on preconceived ideas i may
add that mine were taken from the vivid descriptions in the personal
narrative of humboldt which far exceed in merit anything else which i
have read yet with these high-wrought ideas my feelings were far
from partaking of a tinge of disappointment on my first and final
landing on the shores of brazil 

among the scenes which are deeply impressed on my mind none exceed in
sublimity the primeval forests undefaced by the hand of man whether
those of brazil where the powers of life are predominant or those of
tierra del fuego where death and decay prevail both are temples
filled with the varied productions of the god of nature no one can
stand in these solitudes unmoved and not feel that there is more in
man than the mere breath of his body in calling up images of the
past i find that the plains of patagonia frequently cross before my
eyes yet these plains are pronounced by all wretched and useless they
can be described only by negative characters without habitations 
without water without trees without mountains they support merely a
few dwarf plants why then and the case is not peculiar to myself 
have these arid wastes taken so firm a hold on my memory why have not
the still more level the greener and more fertile pampas which are
serviceable to mankind produced an equal impression i can scarcely
analyze these feelings but it must be partly owing to the free scope
given to the imagination the plains of patagonia are boundless for
they are scarcely passable and hence unknown they bear the stamp of
having lasted as they are now for ages and there appears no limit to
their duration through future time if as the ancients supposed the
flat earth was surrounded by an impassable breadth of water or by
deserts heated to an intolerable excess who would not look at these
last boundaries to man s knowledge with deep but ill-defined sensations 

lastly of natural scenery the views from lofty mountains through
certainly in one sense not beautiful are very memorable when looking
down from the highest crest of the cordillera the mind undisturbed by
minute details was filled with the stupendous dimensions of the
surrounding masses 

of individual objects perhaps nothing is more certain to create
astonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a
barbarian of man in his lowest and most savage state one s mind
hurries back over past centuries and then asks could our progenitors
have been men like these men whose very signs and expressions are
less intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals men 
who do not possess the instinct of those animals nor yet appear to
boast of human reason or at least of arts consequent on that reason i
do not believe it is possible to describe or paint the difference
between savage and civilized man it is the difference between a wild
and tame animal and part of the interest in beholding a savage is the
same which would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his
desert the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle or the rhinoceros
wandering over the wild plains of africa 

among the other most remarkable spectacles which we have beheld may be
ranked the southern cross the cloud of magellan and the other
constellations of the southern hemisphere the water-spout the glacier
leading its blue stream of ice overhanging the sea in a bold
precipice a lagoon-island raised by the reef-building corals an
active volcano and the overwhelming effects of a violent earthquake 
these latter phenomena perhaps possess for me a peculiar interest 
from their intimate connection with the geological structure of the
world the earthquake however must be to every one a most impressive
event the earth considered from our earliest childhood as the type of
solidity has oscillated like a thin crust beneath our feet and in
seeing the laboured works of man in a moment overthrown we feel the
insignificance of his boasted power 

it has been said that the love of the chase is an inherent delight in
man a relic of an instinctive passion if so i am sure the pleasure
of living in the open air with the sky for a roof and the ground for a
table is part of the same feeling it is the savage returning to his
wild and native habits i always look back to our boat cruises and my
land journeys when through unfrequented countries with an extreme
delight which no scenes of civilization could have created i do not
doubt that every traveller must remember the glowing sense of happiness
which he experienced when he first breathed in a foreign clime where
the civilized man had seldom or never trod 

there are several other sources of enjoyment in a long voyage which
are of a more reasonable nature the map of the world ceases to be a
blank it becomes a picture full of the most varied and animated
figures each part assumes its proper dimensions continents are not
looked at in the light of islands or islands considered as mere
specks which are in truth larger than many kingdoms of europe 
africa or north and south america are well-sounding names and easily
pronounced but it is not until having sailed for weeks along small
portions of their shores that one is thoroughly convinced what vast
spaces on our immense world these names imply 

from seeing the present state it is impossible not to look forward
with high expectations to the future progress of nearly an entire
hemisphere the march of improvement consequent on the introduction
of christianity throughout the south sea probably stands by itself in
the records of history it is the more striking when we remember that
only sixty years since cook whose excellent judgment none will
dispute could foresee no prospect of a change yet these changes have
now been effected by the philanthropic spirit of the british nation 

in the same quarter of the globe australia is rising or indeed may be
said to have risen into a grand centre of civilization which at some
not very remote period will rule as empress over the southern
hemisphere it is impossible for an englishman to behold these distant
colonies without a high pride and satisfaction to hoist the british
flag seems to draw with it as a certain consequence wealth 
prosperity and civilization 

in conclusion it appears to me that nothing can be more improving to a
young naturalist than a journey in distant countries it both
sharpens and partly allays that want and craving which as sir j 
herschel remarks a man experiences although every corporeal sense be
fully satisfied the excitement from the novelty of objects and the
chance of success stimulate him to increased activity moreover as a
number of isolated facts soon become uninteresting the habit of
comparison leads to generalization on the other hand as the
traveller stays but a short time in each place his descriptions must
generally consist of mere sketches instead of detailed observations 
hence arises as i have found to my cost a constant tendency to fill
up the wide gaps of knowledge by inaccurate and superficial hypotheses 

but i have too deeply enjoyed the voyage not to recommend any
naturalist although he must not expect to be so fortunate in his
companions as i have been to take all chances and to start on
travels by land if possible if otherwise on a long voyage he may
feel assured he will meet with no difficulties or dangers excepting
in rare cases nearly so bad as he beforehand anticipates in a moral
point of view the effect ought to be to teach him good-humoured
patience freedom from selfishness the habit of acting for himself 
and of making the best of every occurrence in short he ought to
partake of the characteristic qualities of most sailors travelling
ought also to teach him distrust but at the same time he will
discover how many truly kind-hearted people there are with whom he
never before had or ever again will have any further communication 
who yet are ready to offer him the most disinterested assistance 

 after the volumes of eloquence which have poured forth on this
subject it is dangerous even to mention the tomb a modern traveller 
in twelve lines burdens the poor little island with the following
titles it is a grave tomb pyramid cemetery sepulchre catacomb 
sarcophagus minaret and mausoleum 

 it deserves notice that all the many specimens of this shell found
by me in one spot differ as a marked variety from another set of
specimens procured from a different spot 

 beatson s st helena introductory chapter p 

 among these few insects i was surprised to find a small aphodius
 nov spec and an oryctes both extremely numerous under dung when
the island was discovered it certainly possessed no quadruped 
excepting perhaps a mouse it becomes therefore a difficult point to
ascertain whether these stercovorous insects have since been imported
by accident or if aborigines on what food they formerly subsisted on
the banks of the plata where from the vast number of cattle and
horses the fine plains of turf are richly manured it is vain to seek
the many kinds of dung-feeding beetles which occur so abundantly in
europe i observed only an oryctes the insects of this genus in
europe generally feed on decayed vegetable matter and two species of
phanaeus common in such situations on the opposite side of the
cordillera in chiloe another species of phanaeus is exceedingly
abundant and it buries the dung of the cattle in large earthen balls
beneath the ground there is reason to believe that the genus
phanaeus before the introduction of cattle acted as scavengers to
man in europe beetles which find support in the matter which has
already contributed towards the life of other and larger animals are
so numerous that there must be considerably more than one hundred
different species considering this and observing what a quantity of
food of this kind is lost on the plains of la plata i imagined i saw
an instance where man had disturbed that chain by which so many
animals are linked together in their native country in van diemen s
land however i found four species of onthophagus two of aphodius 
and one of a third genus very abundantly under the dung of cows yet
these latter animals had been then introduced only thirty-three years 
previous to that time the kangaroo and some other small animals were
the only quadrupeds and their dung is of a very different quality from
that of their successors introduced by man in england the greater
number of stercovorous beetles are confined in their appetites that
is they do not depend indifferently on any quadruped for the means of
subsistence the change therefore in habits which must have taken
place in van diemen s land is highly remarkable i am indebted to the
rev f w hope who i hope will permit me to call him my master in
entomology for giving me the names of the foregoing insects
